During this time he constantly modified the composition and hence also the statement made by the work, whose form is reminiscent of an altarpiece.

While the commissions included some of the most avant-garde British artists of the time, the British War Memorials Committee advisors saw the scheme as firmly within the tradition of European art commissioning, looking to models from the Renaissance. It was intended that both the art and the setting would celebrate national ideals of heroism and sacrifice. However, the Hall of Remembrance was never built and the work was given to the Imperial War Museum. Nash worked on the painting from June 1918 to February 1919.Nash suggested the following inscription for the painting.

Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871, the conflict was caused primarily by France's determination to restore its dominant position in continental Europe, which it had lost following Prussia's crushing victory over Austria in 1866. According to some historians, Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked the French into declaring war on Prussia in order to draw four independent southern German states\u2014Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt\u2014into an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia. Some historians contend that Bismarck exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. None, however, dispute the fact that Bismarck must have recognized the potential for new German alliances, given the situation as a whole.\nFrance mobilised its army on 15 July 1870, leading the North German Confederation to respond with its own mobilisation later that day.", "items": [{"id": 69219, "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/hTO0VFM4xoBH6CTbwwk3APnZBFffL2jHAyPiIsGNS_V4Bw7iASN05TYicQ", "title": "War 1870-1871 Franco - Prussian 3", "location": null, "description": "WAR 1870-1871 FRANCO - PRUSSIAN 3"}, {"id": 74878, "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/g7sHWlU9HlMcp3QJjzOrxyrqRZgLvUSnzCbN9-jH5NiGgcvmfb5RUqfnCA", "title": "The Siege of Paris", "location": null, "description": "Scenes like this glorifying war were the more typically accepted as fine art."}, {"id": 24755, "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/862zcUhJ8Yv8BFTw0bIbziStQWGH3cFuQ0zWsJiWWhxdDTSzg3vE3J7t33q-", "title": "In the Troops' Quarters outside Paris", "location": null, "description": "This work goes back to Werner\u2019s time with a support command in Versailles twenty-four years earlier during the Franco-Prussian War.

Werner, like the \u201cLandeskunstkommission\u201d (Regional Art Commission), which purchased this work the same year it was painted, was well aware of the popular-ity of war pictures.

The war made up the Chinese theater of the wider Pacific Theater of the Second World War. The beginning of the war is conventionally dated to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident 7 July 1937, when a dispute between Japanese and Chinese troops in Peking escalated into a full-scale invasion. This full-scale war between the Chinese and the Empire of Japan is often regarded as the beginning of World War II in Asia.

The trigger of the war was the discovery of diamonds and gold in the Boer states. Initial Boer attacks were successful, and although British reinforcements later reversed these, the war continued for years with Boer guerrilla warfare, until harsh British counter-measures including a scorched earth policy brought the Boers to terms.\nThe war started with well-armed Boer irregulars and militia striking first, besieging Ladysmith, Kimberley, and Mafeking in early 1900, and winning important battles at Colenso, Magersfontein and Stormberg. Surprised, under-prepared, and overconfident, the British responded bringing in modest numbers of soldiers and fought back with little initial success. Leadership and tactics changed when General Redvers Buller was replaced by Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener. They relieved the three besieged cities and invaded the two Boer republics in late 1900.", "items": [{"id": 43006, "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/f33mtu4qEfTTfMdT4fhKdXC72TRZ9qBYn6rQ0YBRaFVad3fHzJ3_qM9xBQ", "title": "Boers In Battle", "location": null, "description": "Boers manning a trench outside Mafeking during the second Boer War.

The social movement's major nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans.\nAfter the American Civil War and the subsequent abolition of slavery in the 1860s, the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans, most of whom had recently been enslaved.

The Entente powers, Britain, France and Russia, sought to weaken the Ottoman Empire, one of the Central Powers, by taking control of the Turkish straits. This would expose the Ottoman capital at Constantinople to bombardment by Allied battleships and cut it off from the Asian part of the empire. With Turkey defeated, the Suez canal would be safe, and a year-round Allied supply route could be opened through the Black Sea to warm water ports in Russia.\nThe Allied fleet's attempt to force the Dardanelles in February 1915 failed and was followed by an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli peninsula in April 1915. In January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the Entente powers and for the sponsors, especially First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. The campaign was considered a great Ottoman victory.", "items": [{"id": 54547, "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/h58i-IOM0-LY8nLAuS_EEj6mgqHBHMuOjQFs6bDdz-NOh4JnlUR5X5XI", "title": "War 1914-1918 Camp Gallipoli", "location": null, "description": "War 1914-1918 Camp Gallipoli"}, {"id": 67829, "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/UAtezXOWD5oWPobvN1TP06kRINa0CjNSJoee3k6o8T0LeKUHqJLTW8ktqx9uzQ", "title": "Three Russian Army officers visiting British Army and Navy officers", "location": null, "description": "Photograph of a visiting party of three Russian Army officers with British Army and RN officers at Suvla (standing under gantry).

While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city, the Red Army temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to destroy the city in retaliation. The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support.

Widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789, the first since 1614. In June, the Estates were converted into a National Assembly, which passed a series of radical measures, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control of the Catholic Church and extending the right to vote.\nThe next three years were dominated by the struggle for political control, exacerbated by economic depression and social unrest.

The painting's small size and intimate mood reflect its private nature. Suzanne is portrayed bust-length, facing the viewer.

They faced against the invading forces of Imperial Japan, who were supported by the Thai Phayap Army, as well as two collaborationist independence movements and armies, the first being the Burma Independence Army, which spearheaded the initial attacks against the country. Puppet states were established in the conquered areas and territories were annexed, while the international Allied force in British India launched several failed offensives. During the later 1944 offensive into India and subsequent Allied recapture of Burma the Indian National Army, led by revolutionary Subhas C. Bose and his \"Free India\", were also fighting together with Japan. British Empire forces peaked at around 1,000,000 land and air forces, and were drawn primarily from British India, with British Army forces, 100,000 East and West African colonial troops, and smaller numbers of land and air forces from several other Dominions and Colonies.", "items": [{"id": 29740, "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/wPmnLQa3IFPlG5fF_aS_9PZ7QdGlNu9L7fOHQq4CD-4o3Rfd4KvVUMGkXA", "title": "War 1939 1945 Burma Malaya Reheat 1942 And Chindits", "location": null, "description": "WAR 1939 1945 BURMA MALAYA Reheat 1942 and chindits"}, {"id": 85736, "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/BSkPbdGsBI24pB-sK5upEJ50Ga0K9QvuG82sXJgLszJTTkE7ckTZPq54GQ", "title": "War 1939 1945 Burma Malaya Reheat 1942 And Chindits", "location": null, "description": "WAR 1939 1945 BURMA MALAYA Reheat 1942 and chindits"}, {"id": 18699, "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/fVfbsk09OhTSHxrQjUMxz3Xk7ev4Twme1tXTmXpSgH1RgsaDdq95P6Pw", "title": "War 1939 1945 Burma Malaya Reheat 1942 And Chindits", "location": null, "description": "WAR 1939 1945 BURMA MALAYA Reheat 1942 and chindits"}, {"id": 86666, "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/GcWU6ciMGC9iCC5f03SzxodY8yhU-EmTb5QdMQChs0eaW-cPiJnebe-AeIc", "title": "War 1939- 1945.

The Soviets offered to drop the blockade if the Western Allies withdrew the newly introduced Deutsche Mark from West Berlin.\nThe Western Allies organised the Berlin Airlift from 26 June 1948 to 30 September 1949 to carry supplies to the people of West Berlin, a difficult feat given the size of the city's population. Aircrews from the American, British, French, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and South African air forces flew over 200,000 sorties in one year, providing necessities such as fuel and food, with the original plan being to lift 3,475 tons of supplies daily. By the spring of 1949, that number was often met twofold, with the peak daily delivery totalling 12,941 tons.\nHaving initially concluded there was no way the airlift could work, its continued success became an increasing embarrassment for the Soviets.", "items": [{"id": 73753, "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/R_WEx-iXt38R6boXkkVCA2q76rH9CraklJNbjKvnWu-Cw5B2nBq583j_wg", "title": "Berlin Airlift", "location": "Berlin, Germany", "description": "German civilians standing in ruins of a building near Tempelhof Airfield looking up at an American C-47 cargo plane bringing them food & supplies during the Berlin Airlift, intended to break a Soviet blockade of the city."}, {"id": 55701, "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/luKFJ0Yjb4jph-lmnCznKtQXBKbS784ROoQqx6WAxvi5ashlLzgtQ3JNqw", "title": "Berlin Blockade", "location": null, "description": "11th May 1949: Preparing banners over the road block which are to be removed from the Russian-American Sector Boundary during the Berlin Airlift.

It was codenamed Operation Desert Shield for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm in its combat phase.\nOn 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Army invaded and occupied Kuwait, which was met with international condemnation and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the UN Security Council. UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher and US president George H. W. Bush deployed forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II.
