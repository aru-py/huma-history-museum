# Huma History Museum

## Overview 

Step back into time and relive historyâ€™s most poignant moments. [Huma](https://aru.ai/huma) is a three-dimensional history museum in your browser. This repository contains the code used for collecting the data from [Google Arts and Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/category/event).

## Getting the Data

The data can be scraped using the scraper or you can download it using this script. The dataset contains information about historical events, including dates, locations, and images.

```bash
url=data.aru.ai/huma;curl -s $url || curl -o $url
```

## Running the Code

### Prerequisites

Please install python 3.X and project requirements. Place [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) in your path and run scripts inside the `/src` directory.

### Scraping

Run `python scrape.py` to start collecting data. It will open up three windows. Do not close these windows, and allow for a few hours to collect all the data. The script should periodically output a binary file `saved_data.pkl` (for recovery purposes) and the `saved_data.json` file when complete.

### Cleaning

Once data is collected, it is prepared to be used in production. Run `python runner.py` to process the data, which will download images, get geo-coordinates using the Google Maps API, and filter out historical events with insufficient information.

**Example event after preprocessing**

```json
{
  "id": 57186,
  "title": "Cold War",
  "date": 1991,
  "description": "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II.",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 98352,
      "title": "Brandenburg Gate",
      "description": "May 1966: The famous landmark of the Brandenburg Gate stands just behind the Berlin Wall, inside Soviet controlled East Berlin. (Photo by John Waterman/Fox Photos/Getty Images)"
    }
  ],
  "Coords": {
    "lat": 14.058324,
    "lng": 108.277199
  }
}
```

### Generate

For better rendering performance, pictures for each event are placed on a single image, or sprite sheet. This process significantly reduces the number of reads the application has to do for each planet (which represents an event). `generate.py` handles this conversion.
