It involved the vast majority of the world's countries\u2014including all the great powers\u2014forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. In a state of total war, directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in 70 to 85 million fatalities, with more civilians than military personnel killed. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides, premeditated death from starvation, massacres, and disease. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, including in strategic bombing of population centres, the development of nuclear weapons, and the only two uses of such in war.\nWorld War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by the United Kingdom and France on the 3rd.", "items": [{"id": 47595, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/ZgGW7hUE9r2zLw", "description": "A sailor runs for cover past flaming wreckage hit by dive bombers that had already blasted Pearl Harbor and Hickam Field; Kaneohe Bay Naval Station.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/Y_MVQ8IRNqFYYld9n9JHyNz76uYK3BQTyqwdZepypQEHz59zeDzbYFRVsw", "metadata": ["Date: 1941-12", "Location: Kaneohe, HI, US", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Wwii, Air Raids On, Oahu, Hawaiian Islands, Kaneohe Naval Station, Wars, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_72725", "Credits: NATIONAL ARCHIVES"]}, {"id": 15125, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/d-day-landings-robert-sargent/NwHO2ANGnDEvmw", "description": "A view from inside one of the landing craft after US troops hit the water during the Allied D-Day invasion of Normandy, France.

Ten thousand corpses lay unburied, and around 60,000 starving and sick people were packed into the camp\u2019s barracks without food or water. Doris Zinkeisen arrived soon afterwards. Human Laundry is arguably the most powerful work produced by any of the artists who were present. Zinkeisen finds an effective motif in the contrast between the well fed, rounded bodies of the German medical staff and the emaciated bodies of their patients. Although the artist\u2019s later account refers to \u2018the German prisoners\u2019, they were actually nurses and doctors from a nearby German military hospital pressed into service.

While the commissions included some of the most avant-garde British artists of the time, the British War Memorials Committee advisors saw the scheme as firmly within the tradition of European art commissioning, looking to models from the Renaissance.

The term \"cold\" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction discouraged a pre-emptive attack by either side. Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race.", "items": [{"id": 90575, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/l-enrag%C3%A9/CQGlnNG6iTVyKg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/AKI_-tDuV8lBlEym4OjKsa6wsGdUz9jKg2EIM0Q1prQTP5xoQMT3AwWj", "metadata": ["Title: L'Enrag\u00e9", "Date: 1968-06-24", "Contributor: Comit\u00e9 d'action"]}, {"id": 43272, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/todays-weather-hulton-archive/ewFCA9VjlyYhQg", "description": "American president Richard Nixon (1913-1994) points to a map of Southeast Asia during a nationwide broadcast, Viet Nam War.

War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina, just over a month after Lincoln's inauguration. An additional four slave states joined the Confederacy in the following two months.

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea following clashes along the border and insurrections in the south. The war ended unofficially on 27 July 1953 in an armistice.\nAfter the surrender of Japan, at the end of World War II, on 15 August 1945, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation. The Soviets administered the northern-half and the Americans administered the southern-half. In 1948, as a result of Cold War tensions, the occupation zones became two sovereign states. A socialist state was established in the north under the totalitarian leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the authoritarian leadership of Syngman Rhee.

The murders were carried out in pogroms and mass shootings; by a policy of extermination through work in concentration camps; and in gas chambers and gas vans in German extermination camps, chiefly Auschwitz, Be\u0142\u017cec, Che\u0142mno, Majdanek, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka in occupied Poland.\nGermany implemented the persecution in stages. Following Adolf Hitler's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933, the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed \"undesirable\", starting with Dachau on 22 March 1933. After the passing of the Enabling Act on 24 March, which gave Hitler plenary powers, the government began isolating Jews from civil society; this included boycotting Jewish businesses in April 1933 and enacting the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935.", "items": [{"id": 40355, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/anne-frank-at-her-desk/DwG3kHjsZjGM9Q", "description": "Merwedeplein, Amsterdam, April 1941.", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/ztovbXtQlhzkmF6vIjYZthmNSHwy0yP4XWdsHVVN-3NGfsygx882eokO5w", "metadata": ["Title: Anne Frank at her desk.", "Date: 1941-04", "Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands", "External Link: Anne Frank House website", "Copyright: \u00a9 Anne Frank House / Anne Frank-Fonds"]}, {"id": 33492, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/glasses-plundered-from-people-deported-to-auschwitz-auschwitz-birkenau-state-museum-archive/sgFZs6YvxPx3tQ", "description": "Glasses plundered from people deported to Auschwitz.

It began during the First World War, with the February Revolution that was focused in and around the then-capital, Petrograd. The revolution erupted in the context of Russia's major military losses during the war, which resulted in much of the Russian Army being ready to mutiny. In the chaos, members of the Duma, Russia's parliament, assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government. This was dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the Russian nobility and aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, and Emperor Nicholas II abdicated his throne. Grassroots community assemblies called \"Soviets\", which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial proletariat, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias.", "items": [{"id": 89192, "url":

The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period, and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe. Morally and politically, this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832. There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches, such as the Methodists, and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England. Ideologically, the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion, social values, and arts. Technologically, this era saw a staggering amount of innovations that proved key to Britain's power and prosperity. Doctors started moving away from tradition and mysticism towards a science-based approach; modern medicine saw the light of day thanks to the adoption of the germ theory of disease and pioneering research in epidemiology.", "items": [{"id": 93182, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/cymon-and-iphigenia-lord-frederic-leighton/5AE_9EuzQThEIA", "description": "Not only president of the Royal Academy but a Peer of the Realm, Frederick Leighton occupied a uniquely privileged place in the artistic and social establishment of Victorian England. The first of many major paintings he exhibited at the Academy was purchased by Queen Victoria herself - an unbeatable beginning to a lifetime of official reward and international recognition. Leighton's taste, like that of his audience, was for ceremonial arrangements of beautifully draped figures in classical surroundings. The contemporary realities of industrial England made no appearance in his work, which is unashamedly nostalgic and idealising.The languorous splendour of 'Cymon and Iphigenia' - the tale of a raw youth brought to moral excellence by the revelation of feminine beauty - perfectly expresses the technical finesse and intense eroticism of Leighton's style. Iphigenia's extraordinary undulations betray a sensuous sensibility quite as much as the artist's obligatory scrutiny of classical statuary. The direct source of the narrative is Boccaccio's 'Decameron', in which the well-born and handsome young Galesus was renamed Cymon - meaning beast - on account of his brutishness. On a mild afternoon in May, Cymon chanced upon the sleeping Iphigenia, sensing at once that she was 'the loveliest object that any mortal being had ever seen'.

The process uses infrared light to reveal any underdrawing beneath the paint layer. The carbon-based properties of the charcoal underdrawing absorb the IR wavelengths rather than reflecting them, causing the drawing to become visible and the paint surface to be read as transparent. This allows any change of composition to become evident. In the case of Weguelin's The Obsequies of an Egyptian Cat, a number of changes are apparent: The arm and hand held up towards the altar have changed to angle further away from the body.

He started his artistic education as a student painter in 1857 and studied painting at the Acadamy of the Arts in Berlin. In Karlsruhe he continued his studies under Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, Ludwig Des Coudres and Adolf Schroedter. He later spent some time in Italy and Paris where he was fascinated by modern French painting. In 1870, when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, he went to France and remained there until the end of the campaign one year later. In 1867 he took part in the Great Exhibition and studied the works of artists such as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Ernest Meissonier and L\u00e9on Cognie.

The confrontation is often considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale nuclear war.\nIn response to the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey, and the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev agreed to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.\nMeanwhile, the 1962 United States elections were under way, and the White House denied charges for months that it was ignoring dangerous Soviet missiles 90 mi from Florida.", "items": [{"id": 16526, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/cuban-crisis/6wE-BY-dxEY5vw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/TLK9-4IC4wsVxdFGA5VsYqdI76jR8wLIwcwlsNj3jo4WVX1ClQH5QGXx", "metadata": ["Title: Cuban Crisis", "Date: 1959", "Location: Havana, Cuba", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Subject Keywords: Crisis, Cuban", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Joe Scherschel", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_114086278", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 52131, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/cuban-crisis/3QEX1thGvY-VsA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/ILhQhEVgYdKGvI8HMJ4J71RZd4Gh8cFriDLcHLO5ptjebLLHCaGyu6-wLQ", "metadata": ["Title: Cuban Crisis", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Joe Scherschel", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_114095868", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 22907, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/j-f-kennedy-hulton-archive/bQEjGyUgjUF2Qw", "description": "circa 1960: Portrait of John Fitzgerald Kennedy (1917-1963), the thirty-fifth President of the United States who served from 1961 to 1963, when he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.

Second Sino-Japanese War was a military conflict that was primarily waged between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. In China, the war is known as the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, or as the Asian theatre of the World Anti-Fascist War, the latter term originating from Mao Zedong's wartime alliance with Stalin. The war made up the Chinese theater of the wider Pacific Theater of the Second World War. The beginning of the war is conventionally dated to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident 7 July 1937, when a dispute between Japanese and Chinese troops in Peking escalated into a full-scale invasion. This full-scale war between the Chinese and the Empire of Japan is often regarded as the beginning of World War II in Asia. In 2017 the Ministry of Education in the People's Republic of China decreed that the term \"eight-year war\" in all textbooks should be replaced by \u201cfourteen-year war\", with a revised starting date of 18 September 1931 provided by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.", "items": [{"id": 80889, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/china-japan-war/uwGD12OVFoB93Q", "description":

The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favouring political monarchism, capitalism and social democracy, each with democratic and anti-democratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists, notably Makhnovia anarchists and Left SRs, as well as non-ideological Green armies, fought against both the Reds and the Whites. Thirteen foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the former Allied military forces from the just-concluded World War with the goal of re-establishing the Eastern Front. Three foreign nations of the Central Powers also intervened, rivaling the Allied intervention with the main goal of retaining the territory they had received in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.\nAfter the revolution the Bolsheviks swept through Russia nearly unopposed.", "items": [{"id": 12785, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/spain-civil-war-republican-zone-vidal/4gHWIYGKZ8PGmA", "description": "MADRID, 11-11-1936.- Poster placed in the Puerta del Sol with the portrait of Stalin and the extract of a letter sent by him to the \"anti-fascist\" Spanish on the occasion of the nineteenth anniversary of the Soviet Revolution.

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point due to the Union's decisive victory and concurrence with the Siege of Vicksburg. Union Maj. Gen. George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, halting Lee's invasion of the North.\nAfter his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863, Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North\u2014the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen.

He escaped with the help of a volunteer nurse.\nIn January 1865 Powell left the Confederate army, swearing an oath of allegiance to the Union under a false last name\u2014Paine. He became one of Mary Surratt\u2019s boarders on H Street in Washington, where he met John Wilkes Booth.\nOn the night of April 14, Booth assigned Powell the task of killing Secretary of State William Seward. Powell arrived at Seward\u2019s home along with David Herold, a 19-year-old pharmacist\u2019s assistant, claiming they were there to deliver a prescription. The secretary, who had been seriously injured in a carriage accident on April 5, was recovering in bed.\nInsisting he had to deliver the medicine in person, Powell was stopped on the stairs by Seward\u2019s son, Frederick. Powell drew his revolver. When it misfired he clubbed Frederick across the head with it.\nThen Powell burst into the secretary\u2019s room, stabbing Seward in the face and neck with a bowie knife.

Camouflage netting, smoke screening and the camouflaged shipping all contribute to the sense of secrecy and hidden strength conveyed by the painting.Eurich was a marine painter living near Southampton and was very familiar with this part of the coast, overlooking the Isle of Wight. He was a salaried war artist with an honorary commission of Captain in the Royal Marines and would have been able to paint from his own observations. His wartime style has been compared to the sixteenth century Flemish painter Pieter Breughel whose work shows a similar attention to distant detail and purposeful activities.

It was the second revolutionary change of government in Russia in 1917. It took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd on 7 November 1917 [O.S. 25 October]. The rise of the Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions was the precipitating event of the Russian Civil War.\nThe October Revolution followed and capitalized on the February Revolution earlier in the year. Contrary to popular belief, Lenin did not overthrow the Tsar. The February Revolution had overthrown the Tsarist autocracy, resulting in a provisional government.

main theatre of war during the First World War. Following the outbreak of war in August 1914, the German Army opened the Western Front by invading Luxembourg and Belgium, then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France. The German advance was halted with the Battle of the Marne. Following the Race to the Sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France, which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918.\nBetween 1915 and 1917 there were several offensives along this front. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances. Entrenchments, machine gun emplacements, barbed wire and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties during attacks and counter-attacks and no significant advances were made. Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun, in 1916, with a combined 700,000 casualties, the Battle of the Somme, also in 1916, with more than a million casualties, and the Battle of Passchendaele, in 1917, with 487,000 casualties.", "items": [{"id": 45230, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/a-battery-shelled-lewis-percy-wyndham/8gGAGM_z9H4Caw", "description": "The First World War, especially the Western Front, was dominated by artillery.

The British responded, recruiting professional miners, and by summer 1916 they had 33 companies of tunnellers at the Western Front.The tunnel at St Eloi was 1,650 feet long and 125 feet deep. It was used to explode the largest mine of the war. This was one of 19 mines exploded at the launch of the Messines offensive in June 1917 and helped the British 41st Division to capture the village.In 1918 David Bomberg, who had served in the Royal Engineers, was commissioned by the Canadian Government to paint the operation. Bomberg was a major figure in the London avant-garde, influenced by Cubism and Futurism. He reduced his subjects to geometric forms, full of tension and kinetic energy. The Canadians, however, asked him to avoid abstraction, and rejected his first painting as too Futurist. This work is a preparatory sketch for a second version, now in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, in which Bomberg compromised and produced a more representational work. The tension and geometry that interested Bomberg are still evident in the complex rhythm of the beams against the curved tunnel walls and in the figures' poses, but the bright colour and bold abstraction of the first work have disappeared. Bomberg has included himself in the foreground of the picture carrying a heavy beam to show his feeling of being burdened by this task.", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/YXLyt0F3Ll56hmOJSego3HJsG6q1BYDwrPVO3rHRm_Inyxc-Eb6YCutSDVY", "metadata": ["Title: Sappers at Work : Canadian Tunnelling Company, R14, St Eloi", "Creator: Bomberg, David", "Date Created: 1918 - 1919", "Location: Saint-\u00c9loi, Creuse, France", "Physical Dimensions: w558 x h673 mm (unframed)", "Provenance: \u00a9 IWM (Art.IWM ART 2708)", "Type: drawing", "External Link: Imperial War Museum website", "Medium: charcoal"]}, {"id": 32472, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/pontoons-across-the-marne/3gEcMtgo7nhzoQ", "description": "Black and white photograph of American soldiers crossing a pontoon bridge on the Marne River at Lucey, France.

Mustard gas was an indiscriminate weapon causing widespread injury and burns, as well as affecting the eyes. The painting gives clues about the management of the victims, their relative lack of protective clothing, the impact and extent of the gas attack as well as its routine nature \u2013 the football match goes on regardless.The canvas is lightly painted with great skill. Sargent draws the viewer into the tactile relationships between the blinded men. There is a suggestion of redemption as the men are led off to the medical tents, but the overall impression is of loss and suffering, emphasised by the expressions of the men standing in line. In sharp contrast to the victims, the football players are physically and visually co-ordinated and have full kit.Sargent travelled to France with artist, Henry Tonks in July 1918. Tonks describes the context for this work in a letter to Alfred Yockney on 19 March 1920: 'After tea we heard that on the Doullens Road at the Corps dressing station at le Bac-du-sud there were a good many gassed cases, so we went there. The dressing station was situated on the road and consisted of a number of huts and a few tents. Gassed cases kept coming in, lead along in parties of about six just as Sargent has depicted them, by an orderly. They sat or lay down on the grass, there must have been several hundred, evidently suffering a great deal, chiefly I fancy from their eyes which were covered up by a piece of lint... Sargent was very struck by the scene and immediately made a lot of notes.'Sargent was commissioned by the British Government to contribute the central painting for a Hall of Remembrance for World War One. He was given the theme of 'Anglo-American co-operation' but was unable to find suitable subject matter and chose this scene instead. ' The further forward one goes', he wrote 'the more scattered and meagre everything is. The nearer to danger, the fewer and more hidden the men - the more dramatic the situation the more it becomes and empty landscape. The Ministry of Information expects an epic - and how can one do an epic without masses of men?'", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/aZVF134lI4GSJlXrBdZ8Dbm7uOw8YZX_Ei--GhgYdMgULmbinDF1lGCo19aM", "metadata": ["Title: Gassed", "Creator: Sargent, John Singer (RA)", "Date Created: 1919", "Location: Le Bac-du-Sud, Doullens Road, Doullens, Somme, France", "Physical Dimensions: w6111 x h2310 mm (unframed)", "Provenance: \u00a9 IWM (Art.IWM ART 1460)", "Type: painting", "External Link: Imperial War Museum website", "Medium: oil"]}, {"id": 16931, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/nQEh5v9dq36aNA", "description": "Canadian troops with fixed bayonets leaving their trenches for a raid on the Somme during WWI.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/VfcuDBcRS1pUh9tg_epJp1OOjy7fk9chPpE4tp5lI77HJgATH0dmmg-o", "metadata": ["Date: 1916", "Location: Belgium", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Land, Canadian, Personnel, Wars, Belgium, Action, Wwi, 1916, 1910s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_520106", "Credits: MANSELL COLLECTION"]}, {"id": 34427, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-first-vc-of-the-european-war-1914-captain-francis-grenfell-9th-lancers-at-audregnies-24-august-1914/SQFVbLboXbnjBw", "description": "The First VC of the European War, 1914.

Russia had demonstrated an expansionist policy east of the Urals in Siberia and the Far East from the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century.\nSeeing Russia as a rival, Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea being within the Japanese sphere of influence.", "items": [{"id": 14211, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1904-05-russo-japanese-main/JQFDVl_Il56mvA", "description": "War 1904-05 Russo-Japanese Main", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/EYwlmfF3msLN5Pki7vPVffI5mPlkuJ703EJmt2o0fF9RB6dmLyq6RqFv", "metadata": ["Title: War 1904-05 Russo-Japanese Main", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_111412616", "Credits: Mansell", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 12701, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1904-1905-russo-japanese-sea/ywHFP4pFF2uJ5w", "description": "WAR 1904-1905 RUSSO - JAPANESE SEA", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/XAN05o095pL_JSbt17RN3CaFmpLMuco8qnH6jyJFQa1QGI95PingLxKfhQ", "metadata": ["Title: War 1904-1905 Russo - Japanese Sea", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_110864023", "Credits: Mansell", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 85675, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1904-1905-russo-japanese-japanese/UAH1xBy9pVIsdQ", "description": "WAR 1904-1905 RUSSO-JAPANESE.

The aims were to regain control of the Suez Canal for the Western powers and to remove Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalised the canal. After the fighting had started, political pressure from the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations led to a withdrawal by the three invaders. The episode humiliated the United Kingdom and France and strengthened Nasser.\nOn 26 July 1956, Nasser nationalised the canal, which prior to that was owned primarily by Britain and France. On 29 October, Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai. Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. On 5 November, Britain and France landed paratroopers along the Suez Canal. Before the Egyptian forces were defeated, they had blocked the canal to all shipping by sinking 40 ships in the canal. It later became clear that Israel, France and Britain had conspired to plan out the invasion.", "items": [{"id": 72018, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/HAGoDmnKileeqA", "description": "British troops in Suez Canal zone searching persons and effects of Egyptian civilians during tension caused by Egyptian government's demand that British leave.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/nITn1c4w9mg2b41zD7sTP2svE90J_mfCijdzqon4zShLNriy_Cbq9zfalg", "metadata": ["Date: 1951-11", "Location: Egypt", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: In Foreign Country, Egypt, People And Customs, Great Britain, Great Britain Armed Forces, Canals, Suez, Foreign Relations, 1950s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Larry Burrows", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_753308", "Credits: LIFE", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 66601, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/suez-crisis/LAHY_Gfh58GkrA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/a29PqVTkcLQ7DtdN7UHVCrlU8zr7525kLiQX4XeBqfpLkt6G09_pO-iy", "metadata": ["Title: Suez Crisis", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Subject Keywords: Suez, Crisis", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Thomas Mcavoy", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_113287854", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 83312, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/-wF9tGQk-RoXVQ", "description": "Ground-level view of vast crowd in Trafalgar Square demonstrating against Eden and Suez Canal attack.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/fRyEw9fv6xSKtZQijRvePjkFkkn_eqk8yE0nplXJQzQeGr_tDh25xcnNqQ", "metadata": ["Date: 1956-11", "Location: London, United Kingdom", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Canals, Crowds, Suez, British, Nationalization, 1950s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Mark Kauffman", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_957306", "Credits: LIFE", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 61954, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/anthony-eden-baron/iwHiYQO7vsD7Fw", "description": "1956: British prime minister Anthony Eden (1897 - 1977), who resigned in 1957 following controversy over his handling of the Suez Canal crisis.

Civil War was a civil war in Spain fought from 1936 to 1939. Republicans loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, in alliance with anarchists, of the communist and syndicalist variety, fought against a revolt by the Nationalists, an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives and traditionalists, led by a military group among whom General Francisco Franco soon achieved a preponderant role. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle, a war of religion, a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy, between revolution and counterrevolution, and between fascism and communism. According to Claude Bowers, U.S. ambassador to Spain during the war,\nit was the \"dress rehearsal\" for World War II. The Nationalists won the war, which ended in early 1939, and ruled Spain until Franco's death in November 1975.", "items": [{"id": 24331, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/spain-civil-war-anniversary/oQGuG86r_WgJUg", "description": "Political posters from the spanish civil war, CNT (on the left) and Falange (on the right).

The trigger of the war was the discovery of diamonds and gold in the Boer states. Initial Boer attacks were successful, and although British reinforcements later reversed these, the war continued for years with Boer guerrilla warfare, until harsh British counter-measures including a scorched earth policy brought the Boers to terms.\nThe war started with well-armed Boer irregulars and militia striking first, besieging Ladysmith, Kimberley, and Mafeking in early 1900, and winning important battles at Colenso, Magersfontein and Stormberg. Surprised, under-prepared, and overconfident, the British responded bringing in modest numbers of soldiers and fought back with little initial success. Leadership and tactics changed when General Redvers Buller was replaced by Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener. They relieved the three besieged cities and invaded the two Boer republics in late 1900.", "items": [{"id": 90931, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/boers-in-battle-van-hoepen/qwHFQb6vSxaraQ", "description": "Boers manning a trench outside Mafeking during the second Boer War.

The left-wing Jewish Combat Organization and right-wing Jewish Military Union formed and began to train. A small resistance effort to another roundup in January 1943 was partially successful and spurred Polish resistance groups to support the Jews in earnest.\nThe uprising started on 19 April when the ghetto refused to surrender to the police commander SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer J\u00fcrgen Stroop, who ordered the burning of the ghetto, block by block, ending on 16 May. A total of 13,000 Jews died, about half of them burnt alive or suffocated.

Most of the fighting took place in Tonkin in northern Vietnam, although the conflict engulfed the entire country and also extended into the neighboring French Indochina protectorates of Laos and Cambodia.\nAt the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Indochina south of latitude 16\u00b0 north was to be included in the Southeast Asia Command under British Admiral Mountbatten. The Japanese forces located south of that line surrendered to him and those to the north surrendered to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.

The immediate cause of the war involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, then a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the Ottoman Empire's expense. The war stood out for its \"notoriously incompetent international butchery\".\nWhile the churches worked out their differences with the Ottomans and came to an agreement, the French Emperor Napoleon III and the Russian Emperor Nicholas I refused to back down. Nicholas issued an ultimatum demanding that the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection. Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to. When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement, Nicholas recanted and prepared for war.", "items": [{"id": 83868, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/yAHbNC9IwjNgyA", "description": "Illustration of the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava during the Crimean War.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/MlQCuHORouCRcjA8j2q_X3Vxe-ZVgHYOiLJ4h_1XzrFnWbIpVoMPqg1CLQ", "metadata": ["Date: 1901", "Location: Balaclava, Russia", "Physical Dimensions: COLOR TRANSMISSION", "Subject Keywords: Light Brigade, Army, Units, Russia Crimean, Great Britain Armed Forces, Wars, 1900s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_1155768", "Credits: MANSELL COLLECTION"]}, {"id": 57687, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/sebastopol-june-1855-james-d-robertson/-AGaOoE2WevGiw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/xlvOFDFue2lJ-lY_7wS35ZFpsh06zi2ajNTfZVaiVYPVX_sfeDomCRI69-J-kYnucg", "metadata": ["Title: Sebastopol June 1855", "Creator: James D.

It depicts the first victory won by the Piedmontese army against the Austrians during the second war of independence, which led to the addition of Lombardy to the Kingdom of Sardinia. Together with his brother Domenico, Gerolamo Induno was one of the primary narrators of the Risorgimento in painting. Having taken part in the Milanese uprising of 1848 and the defence of the Roman Republic the following year in addition to serving Garibaldi as a volunteer in 1859, he embodied the legendary figure of the artist-soldier. It is thus with a great sense of personal involvement that he depicted the episodes in the hard-fought struggle for national unification, focusing both on their epic character in works like Garibaldi at Sant\u2019Angelo and on their human aspects in intimate genre scenes like A Follower of Garibaldi Bids Farewell. This is one of a series of works that also includes The Battle of Magenta (1861, Milan, Soprintendenza al Patrimonio Architettonico e Paesaggistico, on loan to the Museo del Risorgimento), The Fall of Palestro is a very realistic depiction of the throng of soldiers in the foreground. The mounted figure on the left looking at the newly taken town can probably be identified as Vittorio Emanuele II accompanied by General Enrico Cialdini. In this work the painter continues to develop the new approach to history painting that had already led him to produce works like The Battle of the River Tchernaya on the basis of first-hand observation and sketches from life. With respect to the latter, Induno opts here for a freer style and less detailed definition to capture the immediacy of the event, displaying a narrative intent that brings the work closer to the images of the first series of war photographs, which were taken in the same period.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/cTW2zjIylIPCMVk0iwK6NZw-f94nLAjxyV-5ElJ2sgoGzfXhx4KYijl1B18", "metadata": ["Title: The Fall of Palestro, 30 May 1859", "Creator: Gerolamo Induno", "Date: 1860/1860", "Signature: Ger.o Induno/ 1860", "Physical Dimensions: w300 x h210 cm (Without frame)", "Exhibition History: This work was shown at the Esposizione di Belle Arti dell\u2019Accademia di Brera in 1860 (no. 272)", "Exhibition: Gallerie d'Italia, Piazza Scala, 6, Milano", "Provenance: Cariplo Foundation, 1988", "Type: Painting, oil on canvas", "Rights: http://www.artgate-cariplo.it/en/disclaimer.html", "External Link: www.artgate-cariplo.it"]}, {"id": 70263, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/plan-du-combat-de-sinope-plan-of-the-battle-of-sinope-charles-meryon/2QGFVF3OHypDwg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/or-QKPREohrywcvYriNBGBRyOnBZSIafWTwmsHQuiJyg9QHP0JBTjEFTlkIh", "metadata": ["Title: Plan du Combat de Sinope (Plan of the Battle of Sinope)", "Creator: Charles Meryon", "Date Created: 1853", "External Link: For more information about this and thousands of other works of art in the NGA collection, please visit\u00a0http://www.nga.gov/", "Medium: etching touched with watercolor", "Object Credit: Rosenwald Collection", "Classification: Print", "Artist School: French", "Artist Nationality: French", "Artist Details: French, 1821 - 1868"]}]}, {"id": 21458, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/civil-rights-movement/m0d2c9?categoryId=event", "title": "Civil rights movement", "date": "1954 - 1968", "description": "The civil rights movement in the United States was a decades-long campaign by African Americans and their like-minded allies to end institutionalized racial discrimination, disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States.

The social movement's major nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans.\nAfter the American Civil War and the subsequent abolition of slavery in the 1860s, the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans, most of whom had recently been enslaved. For a short period of time, African American men voted and held political office, but they were increasingly deprived of civil rights, often under the so-called Jim Crow laws, and African Americans were subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by white supremacists in the South.", "items": [{"id": 51488, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/president-lyndon-b-johnson-signs-the-voting-rights-act-as-martin-luther-king-jr-and-other-civil-rights-leaders-look-on-lbj-library-photo-by-yoichi-okamoto/eQE3IIlRNST5TA", "description": "Signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Western Desert campaign took place in the deserts of Egypt and Libya and was the main theatre in the North African campaign of the Second World War. Military operations began in June 1940 with the Italian declaration of war and the Italian invasion of Egypt from Libya in September. Operation Compass, a five-day British raid in December 1940, led to the destruction of the Italian 10th Army. Benito Mussolini sought help from Adolf Hitler, who sent a small German force to Tripoli under Directive 22. The Afrika Korps was formally under Italian command, as Italy was the main Axis power in the Mediterranean and North Africa.\nIn the spring of 1941, Rommel led Operation Sonnenblume, which pushed the Allies back to Egypt except for the Siege of Tobruk at the port. At the end of 1941, Axis forces were defeated in Operation Crusader and retired again to El Agheila. In early 1942 Axis forces drove the Allies back again, then captured Tobruk after the Battle of Gazala but failed to destroy their opponents.", "items": [{"id": 82495, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/zwHGeva61TKE3g", "description": "German General Rommel w. his soldiers shortly before the fall of Tobruk during WWII.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/XiNgaNX62vNasl0KRvRa4MXV8RtGYISKW_xuDuXPjx-1y-fz2ksVHBuizg", "metadata": ["Date: 1942-06-23", "Location: Libya", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Germany Armed Forces, Erwin Rommel, In Foreign Country, Libya, Army, Personnel, Africa, Wars, Wwii, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_1142079", "Credits: MANSELL COLLECTION", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 88758, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1939-1945-wwii-western-desert-2-of-2/cgE3EwEkNQaMyw", "description": "War. 1939-1945.

The revolution began in July 1953, and continued sporadically until the rebels finally ousted Batista on 31 December 1958, replacing his government. 26 July 1953 is celebrated in Cuba as the Day of the Revolution. The 26th of July Movement later reformed along Marxist\u2013Leninist lines, becoming the Communist Party of Cuba in October 1965.\nThe Cuban Revolution had powerful domestic and international repercussions. In particular, it transformed Cuba\u2013United States relations, although efforts to improve diplomatic relations have gained momentum in recent years such as the Cuban thaw. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Castro's government began a program of nationalization, centralization of the press and political consolidation that transformed Cuba's economy and civil society. The revolution also heralded an era of Cuban intervention in foreign military conflicts in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.", "items": [{"id": 39272, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/cuban-crisis/uQFLaKGkvzkMjg", "description": "Cuban rebel Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara w. lit cigar clenched between his teeth & his left arm in a sling.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/AsHOsgOyaB3VtVXKQyfIvfNJe4k45TD0EICAI46JH0ZP-cuVKEGUi0wd", "metadata": ["Title: Cuban Crisis", "Date: 1959-01-07", "Location: Havana, Cuba", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Ernesto Guevara, 1950s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Joe Scherschel", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_279847", "Credits: LIFE", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 79450, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/cuban-crisis/6wE-BY-dxEY5vw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/TLK9-4IC4wsVxdFGA5VsYqdI76jR8wLIwcwlsNj3jo4WVX1ClQH5QGXx", "metadata": ["Title: Cuban Crisis", "Date: 1959", "Location: Havana, Cuba", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Subject Keywords: Crisis, Cuban", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Joe Scherschel", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_114086278", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 36961, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/cuban-crisis/lAEFX-o8lP_Jlw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/pSiUQTZjezF-ZY-ODwlVbBJJMsE9ABQdwOMkL4SOWQHVpgnoCDuQipjr2_A", "metadata": ["Title: Cuban Crisis", "Date: 1959", "Location: Havana, Cuba", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Joe Scherschel", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_114086256", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 99949, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/cuban-crisis/3QEX1thGvY-VsA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/ILhQhEVgYdKGvI8HMJ4J71RZd4Gh8cFriDLcHLO5ptjebLLHCaGyu6-wLQ", "metadata": ["Title: Cuban Crisis", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Joe Scherschel", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_114095868", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 66794, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/j-f-kennedy-hulton-archive/bQEjGyUgjUF2Qw", "description": "circa 1960: Portrait of John Fitzgerald Kennedy (1917-1963), the thirty-fifth President of the United States who served from 1961 to 1963, when he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.

The Entente powers, Britain, France and Russia, sought to weaken the Ottoman Empire, one of the Central Powers, by taking control of the Turkish straits. This would expose the Ottoman capital at Constantinople to bombardment by Allied battleships and cut it off from the Asian part of the empire. With Turkey defeated, the Suez canal would be safe, and a year-round Allied supply route could be opened through the Black Sea to warm water ports in Russia.\nThe Allied fleet's attempt to force the Dardanelles in February 1915 failed and was followed by an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli peninsula in April 1915. In January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the Entente powers and for the sponsors, especially First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. The campaign was considered a great Ottoman victory.", "items": [{"id": 93731, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1914-1918-camp-gallipoli/QgFvWtfL4CnPfA", "description": "War 1914-1918 Camp Gallipoli", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/h58i-IOM0-LY8nLAuS_EEj6mgqHBHMuOjQFs6bDdz-NOh4JnlUR5X5XI", "metadata": ["Title: War 1914-1918 Camp Gallipoli", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_111412285", "Credits: Mansell", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 17822, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/three-russian-army-officers-visiting-british-army-and-navy-officers/0AEsnshC-tO0FQ", "description": "Photograph of a visiting party of three Russian Army officers with British Army and RN officers at Suvla (standing under gantry).

Dux of Scotch College, he studied engineering, law and arts at the University of Melbourne, joining the University Company as a volunteer soldier. After graduating, he began a career in engineering and construction, but at the onset of World War I he was appointed to lead the 4th Infantry Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt. After heading his troops at Gallipoli, in 1916 he moved to the Western Front, where he was to earn his great renown as a tactician, dedicated to minimising casualties through rigorous training, detailed planning and strong technical and mechanical support of his troops. His book on engineering applied to modern warfare, The Australian Victories in France in 1918, was later submitted to the University of Melbourne as a thesis, on the strength of which Monash was awarded the first doctorate in engineering to be conferred by an Australian university. He was promoted to command the Australian Corps in 1918. He returned from the war with copious British, European and American honours, though he later wrote that \u2018nothing could have been more repugnant to me than the realisation of the dreadful inefficiency of, and the misspent energy of, war\u2019. On his return to civilian life, Monash became General Manager, and later Chairman, of the Victorian State Electricity Commission, overseeing its expansion and modernisation. Involved with a number of public organisations including the Boy Scouts and the University of Melbourne, he remained a much- loved public figure in Victoria until his death; his State funeral was attended by some 300,000 people.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/47Jic8Qv4x84kaWNuPIPnPxUq1ok-yBQp3fK4mAhNw8JBsk6xesBgP_XoIqy", "metadata": ["Title: John Monash", "Creator: James Quinn", "Date Created: 1919", "Physical Dimensions: w64 x h76.5 cm (Support)", "Provenance: National Portrait Gallery, Canberra.

Stoker of the AE2", "Creator: Geoffrey Arthur G Haggard", "Date: 1919", "Type: Photograph", "Significance: The story of the AE2 and her infiltration of the Dardanelles in World War I is a highly significant Allied military and Australian naval episode. Although the event did not ultimately alter the course of the war it did demonstrate to Britain that Turkish waters could be breached. Subsequent submarine activity there by E11 and E14 severely hampered Turkish efforts to reinforce and supply their troops engaged at Gallipoli by forcing them to take the more arduous overland route. The success of AE2 in making it through the Dardanelles was news that was relayed to troops at Gallipoli as a sign of an Australian success and an encouragement to dig in. The feat was also mentioned by General Hamilton in his directive to Lieutenant-General Birdwood that Allied troops would remain at Gallipoli for the longer term (Hamilton, quoted by Rhodes James, Gallipoli, London, 1999, p.130).", "See institution's online collections: http://www.anmm.gov.au/collections", "Medium: Silver gelatin print on paper", "Dimensions: 176 x 217 mm", "Credit line: ANMM Collection Gift from Jennifer Smyth"]}]}, {"id": 11073, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/indian-rebellion-of-1857/m03z8w6?categoryId=event", "title": "Indian Rebellion of 1857", "date": "May 10, 1857 - Jul 8, 1859", "description": "The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising in India in 1857\u201358 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. Its name is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.", "items": [{"id": 22259, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1857-1858-indian-mutiny-camp-various/IQFiZmCVy8sc0w", "description": "War 1857-1858 Indian Mutiny.

The German Generalplan Ost aimed to use some of the conquered people as slave labour for the Axis war effort while acquiring the oil reserves of the Caucasus as well as the agricultural resources of various Soviet territories. Their ultimate goal included the eventual extermination, enslavement, Germanization and mass deportation to Siberia of the Slavic peoples, and to create more Lebensraum for Germany.\nIn the two years leading up to the invasion, Germany and the Soviet Union signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes.

The British officially recognise the battle's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940, which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941. German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard the battle as a single campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941, including the Blitz.\nThe primary objective of the German forces was to compel Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement. In July 1940, the air and sea blockade began, with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal-shipping convoys, as well as ports and shipping centres such as Portsmouth. On 1 August, the Luftwaffe was directed to achieve air superiority over the RAF, with the aim of incapacitating RAF Fighter Command; 12 days later, it shifted the attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure.", "items": [{"id": 54922, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/st-paul-s-cathedral-during-the-blitz-herbert-mason/RwGXMMQc6PaW9A", "description": "Herbert Mason, chief photographer at the Daily Mail, was fire-watching on the roof of his office in Fleet Street during the Blitz when he captured this famous image.

The scene includes certain elements constant during the Battle of Britain - the river winding from the town and across parched country, down to the sea; beyond, the shores of the Continent, above, the mounting cumulus concentrating at sunset after a hot brilliant day; across the spaces of sky, trails of airplanes, smoke tracks of dead or damaged machines falling, floating clouds, parachutes, balloons. Against the approaching twilight new formations of Luftwaffe, threatening...'The painting majestically reveals the possibilities of art engaged with history. Its ambition and the scale of the setting immediately impress; we look down on a huge swathe of the English Channel and France beyond. Produced at the time of the battle, the painting encapsulates its scale and importance. However, this is not just an image of modern warfare, with its violence and destruction, or even an iconic victory; it is also a restatement of the value of art and the defeat of Nazism. Nash, a fierce critic of the way that fighting on the Western Front of the First World War had been conducted, was immediate and steadfast in his revulsion towards Nazi Germany and its culture. In the painting, defences rise up as if out of the very landscape of England to meet the fascistic machines of war; the regimented patterns of the Luftwaffe are broken and defeated by Allied fighter planes, they form great flower-like shapes in the sky, before plummeting into the very earth that has defeated them.Richard Seddon, pupil of Nash, viewed this work at Nash\u2019s Oxford studio.

Meade.\nLee's army slipped away from Federal contact at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on June 3, 1863. The largest predominantly cavalry battle of the war was fought at Brandy Station on June 9.

During the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, the Americans destroyed Japan\u2019s reinforcements for the Marianas Islands. This was a costly defeat for the Japanese as it left their forces in the Philippines isolated.MacArthur\u2019s impending return was signaled by the 21 September bombing of Japanese installations around Manila by carrier-based aircraft from Admiral William Halsey\u2019s Third Fleet. Similar bombing raids were mounted in the Visayas. The American air strikes revealed the weakness of Japanese defenses in the Visayas, leading Halsey and MacArthur to conclude that Leyte, and not Mindanao, should be the site of their initial landings. The U.S. invasion force steaming toward Leyte stretched for a hundred miles across the sea, the vast array of ships looking from a distance like black spots on a silver sheet. MacArthur\u2019s entourage aboard the cruiser Nashville included Osme\u00f1a, now President of the Philippine Commonwealth after Quezon\u2019s death in upstate New York in August.On 20 October 1949 at about 10:00 AM, General MacArthur, together with President Osme\u00f1a, General Basilio Valdes, and Resident Commissioner Carlos P. Romulo, waded ashore. Over a Signal Corps microphone Osme\u00f1a addressed the Filipino people, notifying them of the return of legitimate government.Even peasant fighters in the Communist-led Hukbalahap welcomed MacArthur\u2019s return.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/lwd3KVZIAsIzdQsCp-3KVpMKC2Lc0etnYCm2pfcAYgQiUSVIWI8LeP7NCIx9", "metadata": ["Title: Diorama 59: The Return of General MacArthur, Leyte, 1944", "Date Created: 1974 - 2011", "Type: Diorama", "Rights: Ayala Museum, Ayala Museum", "External Link: www.ayalamuseum.com", "Provenance: Purchase (Commissioned work): Complete", "Medium: Mixed media installation (Diorama): Complete", "Creators: Ayala Museum Staff (Historians, Researchers, Artists) and Artisans from Paete, Laguna"]}, {"id": 69639, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/manila-street-fighting-etc-liberation-of-the-philippines/ewECH0pCHEc7XA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/oOlKNZUvG96pS61EF6HngUGyXJtyPX-rTbd2hPsHdzcWChb5n6hon4jL", "metadata": ["Title: Manila (Street Fighting,Etc.)

While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city, the Red Army temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to destroy the city in retaliation. The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military effort taken by any European resistance movement during World War II.\nThe Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide Operation Tempest, launched at the time of the Soviet Lublin\u2013Brest Offensive.

Husky began on the night of 9\u201310 July 1943, and ended on 17 August. Strategically, Husky achieved the goals set out for it by Allied planners; the Allies drove Axis air, land and naval forces from the island and the Mediterranean sea lanes were opened for Allied merchant ships for the first time since 1941. The Italian leader, Benito Mussolini, was toppled from power in Italy and the way was opened for the Allied invasion of Italy.

Before the 1760s, Britain's American colonies had enjoyed a high level of autonomy in their internal affairs, which were managed by colonial legislatures. The passage of the Stamp Act of 1765, which imposed internal taxes on the colonies, led to colonial protest, and the meeting of representatives of several colonies in the Stamp Act Congress. Tensions relaxed with the British repeal of the Stamp Act, but flared again with the passage of the Townshend Acts in 1767.

In 1772 Wertm\u00fcller moved to Paris, where he studied under Joseph Marie Vien and then later at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. However, his future path took on a more cosmopolitan tone. In 1775 he travelled to Rome, where Vien had become the director of the French Academy. He returned to Paris in 1780 and in the same year was appointed court painter to Sweden\u2019s King Gustav III. When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, he moved to Spain and in 1794 he sailed from there to America on a Swedish ship. Later in the 1790s he returned to Paris and Stockholm, before finally settling in the USA. In 1800, he became a US citizen, married Elisabet Henderson, whose family had Swedish roots, and purchased an estate in Delaware where he lived until his death in 1811. Schooled in Paris and Rome, Wertm\u00fcller was a confirmed Neoclassicist, drawing on its plasticity, clear lines and distinct colour palette in his own paintings. His historical paintings primarily depicted mythological subjects, often with a pronounced erotic tone. As a portraitist, he painted a large number of Swedes whom he had met on his travels in Europe and in Stockholm. However, he also received a wide range of international commissions, many from prominent clients \u2013 he painted a portrait of France\u2019s Queen Marie-Antoinette walking with her two children in the gardens of Trianon in Versailles, for example. During his first visit to the USA, he was also commissioned to paint President George Washington.", "Type: Painting", "Rights: Nationalmuseum, Nationalmuseum", "Medium: Oil on canvas"]}, {"id": 61619, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/his-france-1789-1795-revolution-republic-main/vgHzT5Yt2cUmmw", "description": "HIS France 1789-1795 Revolution/Republic Main", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/9EDhcAydHeQUxEPB1IseQ21vi3YHHihi49FPbiuuYK6C9C67kMYMuqw", "metadata": ["Title: His France 1789-1795 Revolution/Republic Main", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_111299914", "Credits: Mansell", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 22147, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/his-euro-france-revolution-1789-mainhead-2-folders-1/swH2QU9XjbjfyA", "description": "HIS EURO France Revolution 1789 Mainhead 2 Folders 1", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/l4oaEpFoVqEjl5uogmKi2cnqTOZZyzl1Nl-zD1cCkLUClv33-xzcRtW3", "metadata": ["Title: His Euro France Revolution 1789 Mainhead 2 Folders 1", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_110711907", "Credits: Mansell", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 32539, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/hQG84LjXX4vTXA", "description": "Engraving of French Revolution from TABLEAUX HISTORIQUES DE LA REVOLUTION FRANCAISE entitled: Commemoration of the Fall of the Bastille.

The painting's small size and intimate mood reflect its private nature. Suzanne is portrayed bust-length, facing the viewer. Her dark hair falls in loose curls around her forehead, accentuating her large, dark eyes. She is fashionably dressed in pale muslin with a soft, black cashmere stole around her neck. Suzanne Le Peletier became a national celebrity at the age of eleven after the murder of her father, the French revolutionary Michel Le Peletier.

against the United Kingdom in 1940 and 1941, during the Second World War. The term was first used by the British press and originated from the term \"Blitzkrieg\", the German word for 'lightning war'.\nThe Germans conducted mass air attacks against industrial targets, towns, and cities, beginning with raids on London towards the end of the Battle of Britain in 1940. By September 1940, the Luftwaffe had lost the Battle of Britain and the German air fleets were ordered to attack London, to draw RAF Fighter Command into a battle of annihilation. Adolf Hitler and Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring, commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered the new policy on 6 September 1940. From 7 September 1940, London was systematically bombed by the Luftwaffe for 56 of the following 57 days and nights. Most notable was a large daylight attack against London on 15 September.\nThe Luftwaffe gradually decreased daylight operations in favour of night attacks to evade attack by the RAF, and the Blitz became a night bombing campaign after October 1940. The Luftwaffe attacked the main Atlantic sea port of Liverpool in the Liverpool Blitz.", "items": [{"id": 98962, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/st-paul-s-cathedral-during-the-blitz-herbert-mason/RwGXMMQc6PaW9A", "description": "Herbert Mason, chief photographer at the Daily Mail, was fire-watching on the roof of his office in Fleet Street during the Blitz when he captured this famous image.

It was part of the South-East Asian theatre of World War II and primarily involved forces of the Allies; the British Empire and the Republic of China, with support from the United States. They faced against the invading forces of Imperial Japan, who were supported by the Thai Phayap Army, as well as two collaborationist independence movements and armies, the first being the Burma Independence Army, which spearheaded the initial attacks against the country. Puppet states were established in the conquered areas and territories were annexed, while the international Allied force in British India launched several failed offensives. During the later 1944 offensive into India and subsequent Allied recapture of Burma the Indian National Army, led by revolutionary Subhas C. Bose and his \"Free India\", were also fighting together with Japan. British Empire forces peaked at around 1,000,000 land and air forces, and were drawn primarily from British India, with British Army forces, 100,000 East and West African colonial troops, and smaller numbers of land and air forces from several other Dominions and Colonies.", "items": [{"id": 13273, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1939-1945-burma-malaya-reheat-1942-and-chindits/BgFRUvNtRCuMRA", "description": "WAR 1939 1945 BURMA MALAYA Reheat 1942 and chindits", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/wPmnLQa3IFPlG5fF_aS_9PZ7QdGlNu9L7fOHQq4CD-4o3Rfd4KvVUMGkXA", "metadata": ["Title: War 1939 1945 Burma Malaya Reheat 1942 And Chindits", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_110862819", "Credits: Mansell", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 69648, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1939-1945-burma-malaya-reheat-1942-and-chindits/nQEXapZLDZltJQ", "description": "WAR 1939 1945 BURMA MALAYA Reheat 1942 and chindits", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/BSkPbdGsBI24pB-sK5upEJ50Ga0K9QvuG82sXJgLszJTTkE7ckTZPq54GQ", "metadata": ["Title: War 1939 1945 Burma Malaya Reheat 1942 And Chindits", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_110862812", "Credits: Mansell", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 54920, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1939-1945-burma-malaya-reheat-1942-and-chindits/ZgGV0o45KVAhVA", "description": "WAR 1939 1945 BURMA MALAYA Reheat 1942 and chindits", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/fVfbsk09OhTSHxrQjUMxz3Xk7ev4Twme1tXTmXpSgH1RgsaDdq95P6Pw", "metadata": ["Title: War 1939 1945 Burma Malaya Reheat 1942 And Chindits", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_110862811", "Credits: Mansell", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 72795, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1939-1945-burma-malaya-push-1944-5/aAFLmtNqWDEJJA", "description": "WAR 1939- 1945.

The trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany, and their decisions marked a turning point between classical and contemporary international law.\nThe first and best known of the trials was that of the major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal. It was described as \"the greatest trial in history\" by Sir Norman Birkett, one of the British judges present throughout. Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946, the Tribunal was given the task of trying 24 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich.

The crimes committed by the Nazis were categorized in accordance with the Charter of the International Military Tribunal as follows: crimes against peace (namely, planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances); war crimes (namely, violations of the laws or customs of war; murder, ill-treatment or deportation to slave labor of civilian population, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war, plunder of public or private property, destruction or plunder of cultural values, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages); crimes against humanity (namely, extermination of Slavic and other nations, creation of secret centers for the extermination of the peaceful population; killing of mental patients).

During the multinational occupation of post\u2013World War II Germany, the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies' railway, road, and canal access to the sectors of Berlin under Western control. The Soviets offered to drop the blockade if the Western Allies withdrew the newly introduced Deutsche Mark from West Berlin.\nThe Western Allies organised the Berlin Airlift from 26 June 1948 to 30 September 1949 to carry supplies to the people of West Berlin, a difficult feat given the size of the city's population. Aircrews from the American, British, French, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and South African air forces flew over 200,000 sorties in one year, providing necessities such as fuel and food, with the original plan being to lift 3,475 tons of supplies daily. By the spring of 1949, that number was often met twofold, with the peak daily delivery totalling 12,941 tons.\nHaving initially concluded there was no way the airlift could work, its continued success became an increasing embarrassment for the Soviets.", "items": [{"id": 55550, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/berlin-airlift/TwHcPbP33T4BDw", "description": "German civilians standing in ruins of a building near Tempelhof Airfield looking up at an American C-47 cargo plane bringing them food & supplies during the Berlin Airlift, intended to break a Soviet blockade of the city.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/R_WEx-iXt38R6boXkkVCA2q76rH9CraklJNbjKvnWu-Cw5B2nBq583j_wg", "metadata": ["Title: Berlin Airlift", "Date: 1948-07", "Location: Berlin, Germany", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Cargo, C47, People And Customs, Us, Wwii, Famous Picture, Planes, Aid, Ruins, 1948, Aircraft, Special Collections, Blockade, Food, Wars, Allied Military Government, Berlin, Aid To, Germany, Us Armed Forces, Cities, Lifting, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Walter Sanders", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_266999", "Credits: LIFE", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 78256, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/berlin-blockade-keystone/gAEGCXdhtavWRw", "description": "11th May 1949: Preparing banners over the road block which are to be removed from the Russian-American Sector Boundary during the Berlin Airlift.

In the mid 15th century, the Serbian\u2013Ottoman wars and the Albanian-Turkish wars were waged by Serbia and Albania respectively against the Ottomans Turks. Much of this period was characterized by Ottoman expansion into the Balkans. The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe.\nThe Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars spanned four centuries, starting in 1423 and lasting until 1718. This period witnessed the fall of Negroponte in 1470, the fall of Famagusta in 1571, the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the fall of Candia in 1669, the Venetian reconquest of Morea in the 1680s and its loss again in 1715.", "items": [{"id": 50411, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/yAHbNC9IwjNgyA", "description": "Illustration of the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava during the Crimean War.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/MlQCuHORouCRcjA8j2q_X3Vxe-ZVgHYOiLJ4h_1XzrFnWbIpVoMPqg1CLQ", "metadata": ["Date: 1901", "Location: Balaclava, Russia", "Physical Dimensions: COLOR TRANSMISSION", "Subject Keywords: Light Brigade, Army, Units, Russia Crimean, Great Britain Armed Forces, Wars, 1900s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_1155768", "Credits: MANSELL COLLECTION"]}, {"id": 75109, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/battle-of-vienna/GgHiVcXh1exqyQ", "description": "This picture belongs to a group of works whose contents refer to the glorification of the person and heroic deeds of King John III Sobieski after the relief of Vienna, which crowned his military successes as a warrior monarch. The glory of the Vienna victor was widely discussed in the entire Europe. Sobieski and his entourage skilfully fuelled these attitudes, carefully constructing the legend, closely connected with the king's dynastic plans. The King reported the triumph to Pope Innocent XI paraphrasing, in the spirit of the Christian humility, the famous words of Caesar: Venimus, vidimus et Deus Vicit. It is not surprising that in such favourable circumstances there appeared numerous commissions for pictures which would immortalise the splendour of that triumph through various artistic means. Once more it was evident how crucial art may be in the self-presentation of a monarch. It does not seem that the artist knew the battle from his own experience.

It depicts the first victory won by the Piedmontese army against the Austrians during the second war of independence, which led to the addition of Lombardy to the Kingdom of Sardinia. Together with his brother Domenico, Gerolamo Induno was one of the primary narrators of the Risorgimento in painting. Having taken part in the Milanese uprising of 1848 and the defence of the Roman Republic the following year in addition to serving Garibaldi as a volunteer in 1859, he embodied the legendary figure of the artist-soldier. It is thus with a great sense of personal involvement that he depicted the episodes in the hard-fought struggle for national unification, focusing both on their epic character in works like Garibaldi at Sant\u2019Angelo and on their human aspects in intimate genre scenes like A Follower of Garibaldi Bids Farewell. This is one of a series of works that also includes The Battle of Magenta (1861, Milan, Soprintendenza al Patrimonio Architettonico e Paesaggistico, on loan to the Museo del Risorgimento), The Fall of Palestro is a very realistic depiction of the throng of soldiers in the foreground. The mounted figure on the left looking at the newly taken town can probably be identified as Vittorio Emanuele II accompanied by General Enrico Cialdini. In this work the painter continues to develop the new approach to history painting that had already led him to produce works like The Battle of the River Tchernaya on the basis of first-hand observation and sketches from life. With respect to the latter, Induno opts here for a freer style and less detailed definition to capture the immediacy of the event, displaying a narrative intent that brings the work closer to the images of the first series of war photographs, which were taken in the same period.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/cTW2zjIylIPCMVk0iwK6NZw-f94nLAjxyV-5ElJ2sgoGzfXhx4KYijl1B18", "metadata": ["Title: The Fall of Palestro, 30 May 1859", "Creator: Gerolamo Induno", "Date: 1860/1860", "Signature: Ger.o Induno/ 1860", "Physical Dimensions: w300 x h210 cm (Without frame)", "Exhibition History: This work was shown at the Esposizione di Belle Arti dell\u2019Accademia di Brera in 1860 (no. 272)", "Exhibition: Gallerie d'Italia, Piazza Scala, 6, Milano", "Provenance: Cariplo Foundation, 1988", "Type: Painting, oil on canvas", "Rights: http://www.artgate-cariplo.it/en/disclaimer.html", "External Link: www.artgate-cariplo.it"]}, {"id": 88851, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/russische-batterij-in-het-fort-redan-tijdens-de-krimoorlog-attributed-to-james-robertson/fQHT4IrtcCaqSw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/97qKRFcXs6gpNCfmUkJTSitaqL45yUybP1a6zZ6Zle2Hgr1WKTUjOb2UVblxiw", "metadata": ["Title: Russische batterij in het fort Redan tijdens de Krimoorlog", "Creator: attributed to James Robertson", "Date Created: 1855/1855", "Physical Dimensions: h 218mm - w 293mm", "External Link: See more details about this work on the Rijksmuseum Website", "Medium: paper"]}, {"id": 48858, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/zouaven-en-andere-soldaten-tijdens-de-krimoorlog-roger-fenton-thomas-agnew-sons/XQE0prwARz-fsw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/Chv1SdPY8O1FRbQLaDpSapaIk5e9ah_3hibYDnXrf-XVRV39VWN35c74joQs", "metadata": []}, {"id": 64092, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/relief-of-the-battle-of-sisak-unknown/gAG6Ddbia5DZFQ", "description": "Three historical events are linked in terms of content \u2013 fighting between the Christian and Turkish armies, but separated in terms of time and place. The most important of them is the Battle of Sisak on 22 June 1593, in which a Christian force overcame a Turkish army three times its size under the command of Hasan Pasha, in a brief, violent battle lasting an hour. Individual military units of the two armies are marked with the name of the commander, colours and standards, and the clothing and arms are also evident. The battle is shown clearly on the relief, in a number of scenes. The victorious infantry and cavalry of the Christian army advance valiantly and successfully (Andrej Auersperg is among them), the Turkish army flees on all sides, some are facing the River Kolpa and a large number of Turks (including Hasan Pasha) drown in its waves. The next event (lower right) shows Andrej Auersperg\u2019s triumphant entry into Karlovac on 28 June 1593.

It was the first major land offensive by Allied forces against the Empire of Japan.\nOn 7 August 1942, Allied forces, predominantly United States Marines, landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida in the southern Solomon Islands, with the objective of using Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases in supporting a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. The Japanese defenders, who had occupied those islands since May 1942, were outnumbered and overwhelmed by the Allies, who captured Tulagi and Florida, as well as the airfield \u2013 later named Henderson Field \u2013 that was under construction on Guadalcanal.\nSurprised by the Allied offensive, the Japanese made several attempts between August and November to retake Henderson Field.",

September 11 attacks. The targets of the campaign are primarily Sunni Islamic fundamentalist armed groups located throughout the Muslim world, with the most prominent groups being Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, the Taliban, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, and the various franchise groups of the former two organizations. The naming of the campaign uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined. U.S. president George W. Bush first used the term \"war on terrorism\" on 16 September 2001, and then \"war on terror\" a few days later in a formal speech to Congress. In the latter speech, George Bush stated, \"Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.\" The term was originally used with a particular focus on countries associated with al-Qaeda. The term was immediately criticised by such people as Richard B.", "items": [{"id": 26133, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/don-t-matter-how-raggly-the-flag-it-still-got-to-tie-us-together-thornton-dial/qAFMZh7QAb-FdA", "description": "The unifying power of a nation\u2019s ideals is the subject of Dial\u2019s piece titled \"Don\u2019t Matter How Raggly the Flag, It Still Got to Tie Us Together.\" In this work from 2003, the image of a torn and ravaged United States flag reifies the social and political struggle underlying American history, the metaphoric wear and tear suffered by the values of freedom, liberty, and equality for which that flag has symbolically stood. Embedded on either side in the \ufb01eld of shredded stars-and-stripes are two figures, one black and the other white, which serve as icons for racial difference and human divisiveness. Created just after the start of the Iraq War, the painting also conjures up the end-game horror of an unchecked quest for domination and power as the flag\u2019s bands of patriotic red and white turn into festoons of bloody bandages on a gory battle\ufb01eld. Like the endless line of flag-draped coffins that signal the return home of dead soldiers, the bodies of Dial\u2019s two figures are bound together within the same striped shroud. Now brothers of the same cloth, they lie side by side on a floating ground made from countless mattress coils. It is Dial\u2019s punning signifier for one final moralism: We have created a hard bed for ourselves, and the only hope and recourse for humanity is the realization that we must find a way to lie in it together.", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/h3HBOLzTiBKOpTkiWLz7Cd8n4qNUPuXztI2134xbrqfHWvSHQug26myX3xLqP3WR7P0", "metadata": ["Title: Don't Matter How Raggly the Flag, It Still Got to Tie Us Together", "Creator: Thornton Dial", "Creator Lifespan: 1928/2016", "Creator Nationality: American", "Creator Gender: Male", "Creator Death Place: McCalla, Alabama", "Creator Birth Place: Emelle, Alabama", "Date Created: 2003", "Physical Location: Indianapolis Museum of Art, Museum purchase and gift of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation", "Location Created: McCalla, Alabama", "Physical Dimensions: 71 x 114 x 8 in.

In this epic painting, which measures over ten feet long, Dial captures the carnage of human conflict, a barbed-wire world mangled and tangled in the wake of its own self-destruction. Hidden within the scene are tiny, gruesome dramas of slaughter and death, as everywhere the gray and green spots of military camouflage are joined by patternings of red, white and blue, ironic signifiers for the American dream of freedom and democracy that turn, at times, into splatters of blood. Finally, hovering above it all are two metal bars with flag-like stripes that form the patriotic V for victory, the delusional rhetoric of triumph etched atop the wreckage of war. Dial\u2019s \"Victory in Iraq\" is a true wartime junk heap, filled with the burnt and crumbling detritus of battle, as well as with the exploded myths of political self-deception. Produced at a time when the world had begun to question the justifications for one country\u2019s desire to topple another, it reeks not only with the scent of a bombed and scorched landscape but with suspicions of public deception and obfuscation. Nearly concealed from sight within Dial\u2019s glut of gloomy debris is the remnant of a can of Halvoline motor oil, the reminder of a persistent rumor about other, undisclosed motives behind the U.S. invasion. Still, beyond such clues, it is difficult to know exactly where Dial stands on the politics of the conflict. When asked, he alludes to a scriptural passage on the inevitability of human aggression in which Christ warns: \u201cAnd ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye not be troubled: for all these things must come to pass . . . .\u201d", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/UBI63MrYm_v4KUD7NKUq1ZtNzpUZrc45acaHTaGGNexgxlYsZnIzFxB_huSTEDs0dG8", "metadata": ["Title: Victory in Iraq", "Creator: Thornton Dial", "Creator Lifespan: 1928/2016", "Creator Nationality: American", "Creator Gender: Male", "Creator Death Place: McCalla, Alabama", "Creator Birth Place: Emelle, Alabama", "Date Created: 2004", "Physical Location: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gift of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation", "Location Created: McCalla, Alabama", "Physical Dimensions: 83 1/2 x 135 x 16 1/2 in.

The war led to the U.S. emerging predominant in the Caribbean region, and resulted in U.S. acquisition of Spain's Pacific possessions. That led to U.S. involvement in the Philippine Revolution and later to the Philippine Insurrection.\nThe main issue was Cuban independence. Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish colonial rule. The U.S. backed these revolts upon entering the Spanish\u2013American War. There had been war scares before, as in the Virginius Affair in 1873. But in the late 1890s, American public opinion swayed in support of the rebellion due to reports of concentration camps set up to control the populace. Yellow journalism exaggerated the atrocities to further increase public fervor, and to sell more papers.\nThe business community had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains. Accordingly, most business interests lobbied vigorously against going to war.", "items": [{"id": 12414, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/sampson-s-fleet-a-gunner-of-the-iowa-william-h-rau-born-phildelphia-pa-1855-died-phildelphia-pa-1920/2AG2vlbTMg2LdQ", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/CTAdn0k7drE7XrcHAPebaAlbQxf6TTaQQJV1z324GmcfWW1QawT0qZgO2ptNxq1SRQ", "metadata": ["Title: Sampson's Fleet.

It was codenamed Operation Desert Shield for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm in its combat phase.\nOn 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Army invaded and occupied Kuwait, which was met with international condemnation and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the UN Security Council. UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher and US president George H. W. Bush deployed forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II. Most of the coalition's military forces were from the US, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost.\nThe war marked the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the US network CNN.", "items": [{"id": 71024, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/us-in-gulf/DgE_Aapg-4ultw", "description": "US Navy aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt deck crew loading photo reconnaissance pod onto F-14 Tomcat fighter for mission over northwest Iraq in support of post-Gulf War Op Provide Comfort aiding Iraqi Kurds, in Persian Gulf.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/Xq1_RqqboXxuB2tc3nWk8jQbeGSZnU7BKp9HR8-V0HkQ7QO9mOrelwT0rw", "metadata": ["Title: Us In Gulf", "Date: 1991-04-26", "Physical Dimensions: COLOR TRANSPARENCY", "Subject Keywords: In Foreign Country, Aircraft Carriers, Atomic, Ships, Wars, Middle East, Planes, Air, Roosevelt, Theodore, F14, Iraq, Photography, Aircraft Maintenance, Fighters, Gulf Crisis, Us Armed Forces, Aircraft, 1990s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_5506113", "Credits: TIME"]}, {"id": 12527, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/us-in-gulf/JQGahGaROUvjpw", "description": "US Navy VFA-87 F/A-18 Hornet fighter coming in for landing on deck of aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt during mission in support of post-Gulf War Op Provide Comfort aiding Iraqi Kurds, in Persian Gulf.", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/w67dNDTb4InkuZ00J6AICZTLN-PIlx5sFUIrqDpw61VnN-8Umgu8SKjL", "metadata": ["Title: Us In Gulf", "Date: 1991-04-26", "Physical Dimensions: COLOR TRANSPARENCY", "Subject Keywords: Iraq, Fa18, In Foreign Country, Aircraft Carriers, Atomic, Ships, Fighters, Wars, Gulf Crisis, Middle East, Planes, Us Armed Forces, Aircraft, Roosevelt, Theodore, 1990s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_5506093", "Credits: TIME"]}, {"id": 81985, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/2QFPM9qiHbk7kw", "description": "F-117A Stealth fighter plane being refueled over Saudi Arabia, for story of US/UN forces in gulf deterring Iraqi aggression.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/DZTJFYpj-NS8FBYsElfzMDuPy_ziBJEP0jGru4c-OUTZ6mTw4MJ-FnDv", "metadata": ["Date: 1990", "Location: Saudi Arabia", "Physical Dimensions: COLOR TRANSPARENCY", "Subject Keywords: Fighters, Arabs, Aircraft Maintenance, Gulf Crisis, Aircraft, Planes, Us Armed Forces, F117A, 1990s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_77017", "Credits: TIME"]}, {"id": 88798, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/desert-shield/UgEWvqzqyYXK7g", "description": "US 82nd Airborne Division TOW missile carrier disguised by camouflage, desert-set, Desert Shield site in US-led allied OP to contain Iraq/Kuwait gulf crisis.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/2S8olg0a8Ex3dO1ss9ur33JUEQFgfE6VmSc2yqo7lKvEEfgetxj10Gkvkw", "metadata": ["Title: Desert Shield", "Date: 1990", "Location: Saudi Arabia", "Physical Dimensions: COLOR TRANSPARENCY", "Subject Keywords: In Foreign Country, Army, Tow, Camouflage, Desert Warfare, Equipment, Us, 82Nd Division, Missile Launchers, Saudi Arabia, Arabs, Gulf Crisis, Aid To, Us Armed Forces, Units, Airborne Command, 1990s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_145942", "Credits: LIFE"]}, {"id": 76275, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/desert-shield/TQFnhnJCmJxMWw", "description": "HEMTT - Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck lowered fr.

change that led to the opening of East Germany's borders with the west, the end of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in the German Democratic Republic and the transition to a parliamentary democracy, which enabled the reunification of Germany in October 1990. This happened through non-violent initiatives and demonstrations. This period of change is referred to in German as Die Wende.\nThese events were closely linked to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's decision to abandon Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe as well as the reformist movements that spread through Eastern Bloc countries. In addition to the Soviet Union's shift in foreign policy, the GDR's lack of competitiveness in the global market, as well as its sharply rising national debt, hastened the destabilization of the SED's one-party state.\nThose driving the reform process within the GDR included intellectuals and church figures who had been in underground opposition for several years, people attempting to flee the country, and peaceful demonstrators who were no longer willing to yield to the threat of violence and repression.", "items": [{"id": 12043, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/chiselling-the-wall-steve-eason/JgHO0kusuW8IPg", "description": "A little girl chisels away at the Berlin Wall from the east side on New Year's Eve, 31st December 1989.

This map was revised from a 1607 map by the Dutch chart maker Willem Janszoon Blaeu, and published in 1609 by the Dutch engraver Petrus Kaerius (Pieter van den Keere).\nAccording to the Latin poetry under each figure in Kaerius's map, the monarchs in the screen are identified as the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, the Ottoman Sultan, the Grand Duke of Moscow, and the Great Khan of the Mongolian Tatar. In the analogy with the Dutch map, two couples of monarchs raise their swords and are about to battle against each other.\nThis screen painting is presumed to be painted by Japanese painters in \"Seminario\", schools of the Society of Jesus in Nagasaki in the early 17th century. It might be given by Jesuit leaders to major daimyos including Tokugawa Ieyasu, because it had been inherited in the Matsudaira Clan of the Aizu province (today\u2019s Fukushima pref.) which was established by Hoshina Masayuki (1611-1673), one of the grandsons of Ieyasu. Originally, this screen painting was the one of a pair of eight-panel screens that depicted foreign eight kings on horseback. It was supposed to be secured in the Tsurugaoka castle of the Matsudaira Clan until the beginning of the Meiji era (1868). The other screen had been inherited in the Matsudaira family until the middle 20th century. At present, it is conserved in the Suntory Art Museum, Tokyo.", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/ChIdffwOyRbkzdHl0rPt5MMJ7gjkuNdfQhLq9DETCRCdS-VY8uLysOv1joda", "metadata": ["Title: Emperor and Kings on Horseback", "Creator: Unknown Japanese Painter", "Date: 1611 - 1614", "Physical Dimensions: w460.4 x h166.2 cm", "Type: Painting", "External Link: \u300c\u6cf0\u897f\u738b\u4faf\u9a0e\u99ac\u56f3\u300d\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u60c5\u5831", "Medium: \u7d19\u672c\u91d1\u5730\u8457\u8272"]}, {"id": 51144, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/procession-of-korean-mission-in-edo-hanegawa-t%C5%8Dei/xQEnum2m7ihcEA", "description": "\u3000\u5bb9\u5100\u3092\u6b63\u3057\u3066\u6574\u7136\u3068\u884c\u9032\u3059\u308b\u9a0e\u99ac\u4eba\u7269\u3092\u542b\u3080\u671d\u9bae\u901a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u3092\u900f\u8996\u56f3\u6cd5\u3092\u63a1\u308a\u3044\u308c\u3066\u63cf\u3044\u305f\u98a8\u666f\u753b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u69d8\u5f0f\u306f1740\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6c5f\u6238\u306b\u8a95\u751f\u3057\u3001\u753b\u4e2d\u306e\u4e8b\u7269\u304c\u7acb\u4f53\u7684\u306b\u898b\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304b\u3089\u6d6e\u7d75(\u3046\u304d\u3048)\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u305f\u3002\u672c\u56f3\u306e\u7bb1\u66f8\u304d\u306b\u3082\u300c\u6d6e\u7d75\u300d\u3068\u898b\u3048\u308b\u3002\u672c\u56f3\u306f\u5c06\u8ecd\u306e\u4ea4\u66ff\u306e\u969b\u306a\u3069\u306b\u6765\u65e5\u3057\u305f\u671d\u9bae\u901a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u306e\u3046\u3061\u3001\u5bdb\u5ef6\u5143\u5e74\uff081748\uff09\u7b2c10\u56de\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u306e\u884c\u5217\u3092\u3082\u3068\u306b\u3057\u3066\u63cf\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u63a8\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u8981\u4eba\u3068\u305d\u306e\u4e00\u884c\u304c\u5c06\u8ecd\u3078\u306e\u6328\u62f6\u3092\u7d42\u3048\u3066\u3001\u4f7f\u9928\u306e\u6d45\u8349\u672c\u9858\u5bfa\u3078\u623b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u5e38\u78d0\u6a4b(\u3068\u304d\u308f\u3070\u3057)\u3092\u6e21\u308a\u3001\u672c\u753a(\u307b\u3093\u3061\u3087\u3046)\u4e8c\u4e01\u76ee\u3092\u904e\u304e\u3066\u3044\u304f\u60c5\u666f\u3092\u63cf\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\n\u3000\u53ce\u7d0d\u7bb1\u306e\u8cbc\u7d19\u304b\u3089\u3053\u306e\u56f3\u304c\u3001\u5fb3\u5ddd\u5409\u5b97\u306e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b50\u3001\u7530\u5b89\u5b97\u6b66\u306e\u5b50\u3067\u3001\u5b9d\u66a63\u5e74(1753)\u306b\uff19\u6b73\u3067\u592d\u6298\u3057\u305f\u5c0f\u6b21\u90ce(\u5b5d\u6148\u9662)\u306e\u611b\u73a9\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308b\u3002\u5c0f\u6b21\u90ce\u306e\u6b7b\u5f8c\u3001\u5b9d\u66a64\u5e74\u306b\u7406\u6027\u9662\u5c3c\u304b\u3089\u6771\u53e1\u5c71\u5bdb\u6c38\u5bfa\u306e\u5b50\u9662\u3067\u3001\u5c0f\u6b21\u90ce\u304c\u846c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u51cc\u96f2\u9662\u306e\u50e7\u6b63\u5149\u4fca\u306b\u8d08\u3089\u308c\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306b\u5149\u4fca\u304b\u3089\u5b9d\u66a611\u5e74(1761)\u306b\u5ef6\u66a6\u5bfa\u307e\u3067\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3002\u672c\u56f3\u304c\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u306e\u7d30\u90e8\u3068\u7570\u306a\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u5c71\u738b\u796d\u308a\u306e\u5510\u4eba\u884c\u5217\u3068\u898b\u306a\u3059\u610f\u898b\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u796d\u308a\u306e\u60c5\u666f\u3060\u3051\u3068\u306f\u8a00\u3044\u304d\u308c\u305a\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u306e\u884c\u5217\u304c\u4e3b\u3067\u3001\u305d\u308c\u306b\u796d\u308a\u306e\u8a18\u61b6\u304c\u6df7\u5728\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u753b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/ewVhoKHWzqk3Fsk-DM1UfCCt_6JWjQFF-f9cbJp9m-sA0MKEg6x0UATmkrHJ", "metadata": ["Title: Procession of Korean Mission in Edo", "Creator: Hanegawa T\u014dei", "Date: Circa 1748", "Physical Dimensions: w91.2 x h69.7 cm", "Type: Painting", "External Link: \u300c\u671d\u9bae\u901a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u6765\u671d\u56f3\u300d\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u60c5\u5831", "Medium: \u7d19\u672c\u8457\u8272"]}, {"id": 98227, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/one-hundred-famous-views-of-edo-%E2%80%9Cmannenbashi-bridge-at-fukagawa%E2%80%9D-utagawa-hiroshige/eQEwzY1bCpjAHQ", "description": "Turtles were symbols of longevity and the name of the bridge, Mannenbashi, means 10,000 years bridge.

Autumn grasses or autumn plains were common subjects for screens but as this pair depicts a new moon on the right-hand screen and Mount Fuji on the left, we know it to be a picture of the Musashino plains. In ancient poems we hear that: \u2018Musashino is a place devoid of peaks behind which the moon may set, just white clouds over the grasses\u2019, or \u2018Musashino is a place with no mountains behind which the moon may set, it rises and sets in the grasses\u2019. This kind of design became popular in the Momoyama period, later becoming standardized during the Edo period. In this work, the grasses are large and depicted with vigor while Mt. Fuji is portrayed in ink with great grandeur, the entire picture overflowing with the richness of nature, making it clear that it was painted in the period before the subject had been reduced to a formalized pattern.\nThere is no signature or seal to identify the artist, but judging from the style, it is thought to be the work of an artist belonging to the Hasegawa school, one theory being that it is by HASEGAWA Togaku (? - 1623), son-in-law of the school\u2019s founder, HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539-1610), another being that it was carried out by Tohaku himself in cooperation with his eldest son, Kyuzo (1568-93). Works in a similar style by the Hasegawa school can be seen in the wall paintings of Chishaku-in Temple, created by Tohaku\u2019s studio, the \u2018Bush Clover and Eulalia Screen\u2019 by Tohaku, or Totaku\u2019s \u2018Autumn Grasses Screen\u2019 (Nanzen-ji Temple). The Hasegawa School was founded by HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539 - 1610), who also referred to himself as the \u2018Fifth Generation Sesshu\u2019 at the same time that UNKOKU Togan was insisting that he was Sesshu\u2019s true successor.", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/lwaDkC5RrqxfWVjGanvrSIDo7HHIfOkngTAapMHXxhOD1NZ-uBHgPhzmJ4HB", "metadata": ["Title: Screen depicting Musashino Plains", "Creator: Hasegawa School", "Date: Momoyama - early Edo period (16-17th century)", "Physical Dimensions: w367 x h165.8 cm each", "Type: Pair of six-panel folding screens, ink, color and gold on paper"]}, {"id": 47959, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/1-1-scale-photo-of-an-edo-period-woodblock-print-marked-as-a-guide-for-tracing-and-cutting-blocks-for-a-reproduction/swEeYHduudfSLA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/-SuIbyOEK0KwzuZdpZ5wh3VaK3_7vcn680HYjjCqE0zXolsG7tgDG0DX", "metadata": ["Title: 1.1. scale photo of an Edo period woodblock print marked as a guide for tracing and cutting blocks for a reproduction", "Date Created: -1/1", "Location: Japan", "External Link: For more information about this and thousands of other works of art in the Freer|Sackler collection, please visit http://www.asia.si.edu/.", "Medium: Photograph", "Credit Line: Gift of Uchikawa Matashiro.", "Collection: Freer Study Collection"]}, {"id": 21109, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/koto-so-tasuke-attributed-to/sgGU_6G5zUjKxw", "description": "This is a So (koto) made by Attribyted Tasuke, who is the famous excellent So maker around Edo period through to Taisho period in Osaka.", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/pu_z9sssYhvgH2w8wZiA5O-2Xxm1J2tN5mJdI2V7UTk3E6ZL6LYoUseiCOMD", "metadata": ["Title: Koto(So)", "Creator: Tasuke (attributed to)", "Date: 1900/1980", "title (japanese): \u7b8f", "artist name (japanese): (\u4f1d\uff09\u592a\u52a9", "area (japanese): \u65e5\u672c", "Type: Musical Instrument"]}, {"id": 18686, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/writing-box-with-a-man-crossing-ujibashi-bridge-from-%EF%BD%94he-tale-of-genji-lacquer-with-maki-e-sprinkled-gold-unknown/GgGk26ubn8qVgw", "description": "This inkstone box has an overhanging lid.

The outbreak of the revolution in 1910 resulted from the increasing unpopularity of the 31-year regime of Porfirio D\u00edaz and the regime's failure to find a controlled solution to the issue of presidential succession. That resulted in a power struggle among competing elites, which provided the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. The wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged D\u00edaz in the 1910 presidential election and, following the rigged results, revolted under the October 1910 Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed.\nArmed conflict broke out in earnest in November 1910 starting in northern Mexico, led by Madero, Pascual Orozco, and Pancho Villa. These Maderista forces received support from portions of the middle class, the peasantry, and organized labor, enabling them to pursue a military campaign in the north ending with Orozco's capture of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in May 1911.", "items": [{"id": 98362, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/mexican-revolution-paintings/JgEX3L_wWQ8vfg", "description": "", "image_url":

As of 15 April 2021, more than 138 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 2.97 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.\nSymptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threatening illness. The virus spreads mainly through the air when people are near each other. It leaves an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enters another person via their mouth, nose, or eyes. It may also spread via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to two weeks, and can spread the virus even if they are asymptomatic.", "items": [{"id": 69926, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/unhq-prepares-for-staff-returning-during-covid-19-pandemic-un-photo-manuel-elias/lQEg7b7N6nIbSg", "description": "UNHQ Prepares for Staff Returning During COVID-19 Pandemic\nFacilities Management Service staff cleans the carpet in the General Assembly Hall.\u2028\u2028The UN Headquarters is preparing for staff to return to work from the office during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/14ob6P0OzFzrjMmBEr4hdlMR3p4ZFwrlA9BLyafZsyyKWAKJbjICs591Zh8n11MAQDA", "metadata": ["Title: UNHQ Prepares for Staff Returning During COVID-19 Pandemic", "Creator: UN Photo/Manuel Elias", "Date Created: 2020-05-27", "Location Created: United Nations, New York", "Subject Keywords: UN75, United Nations", "Type: Photograph", "Rights: UN Photo"]}, {"id": 92474, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/%C3%81ngeles-en-la-pandemia-gerardo-daniel-vieyra-p%C3%A9rez/7QEj3l_XoCLFUQ", "description": "Una trabajadora de limpieza recorre los muros de la parroquia del Esp\u00edritu Santo y Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de F\u00e1tima ubicada en la colonia Ampliaci\u00f3n Selene, Tl\u00e1huac, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, para llevar a cabo labores de recolecci\u00f3n de residuos en la zona", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_alEmIe3Bnp4otcDTL-r3heMwTi5eQPflxzJrIwVy0jZqMncgAuVfN-wYEy6j-a9A", "metadata": ["Title: \u00c1ngeles en la pandemia", "Creator: Gerardo Daniel Vieyra P\u00e9rez", "Date Created: 2020-08-20", "Location: Tlahuac, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico", "Provenance: 11\u00b0 Concurso Nacional de Fotograf\u00eda - Mujeres trabajadoras.

The period is often also called the Fall of Communism and sometimes called the Fall of Nations or the Autumn of Nations, a play on the term Spring of Nations that is sometimes used to describe the Revolutions of 1848. These revolutions started with the Polish workers' mass strike movement on 21 April 1988, and ended when Cambodia enacted a new Constitution, in which Communism was abandoned, on 24 September 1993.\nThe events of this revolution began in Poland in 1988 and continued in Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Romania. One feature common to most of these developments was the extensive use of campaigns of civil resistance, demonstrating popular opposition to the continuation of one-party rule and contributing to the pressure for change.

It prohibits unequal application of voter registration requirements, racial segregation in schools and public accommodations, and employment discrimination. The act \"remains one of the most significant legislative achievements in American history\".\nInitially, powers given to enforce the act were weak, but these were supplemented during later years. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several different parts of the United States Constitution, principally its power to regulate interstate commerce under Article One, its duty to guarantee all citizens equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment, and its duty to protect voting rights under the Fifteenth Amendment.\nThe legislation had been proposed by President John F. Kennedy in June 1963, but it was opposed by filibuster in the Senate. After Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed the bill forward.", "items": [{"id": 44787, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/president-lyndon-b-johnson-speaks-to-the-nation-before-signing-the-civil-rights-act/fgHSYB9Akt5Q3A", "description": "Courtesy of Lyndon Baines Johnson Library & Museum.

It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region in Belgium and Luxembourg towards the end of the war in Europe. The offensive was intended to stop Allied use of the Belgian port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines, allowing the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces and cause the Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis powers' favor.\nThe Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war. The battle also severely depleted Germany's armored forces; they remained largely unreplaced throughout the war. German personnel, and, later, Luftwaffe aircraft also sustained heavy losses.", "items": [{"id": 25502, "url":

A student delegation, entering the radio building to try to broadcast the students' demands, was detained. When the delegation's release was demanded by the protesters outside, the protesters were fired upon from within the building by the State Security Police, known as the \u00c1VH.

The operation involved some 75,000 troops and 261 naval vessels and led to the recapture of the South Korean capital of Seoul two weeks later. The code name for the operation was Operation Chromite.\nThe battle began on 15 September 1950 and ended on 19 September. Through a surprise amphibious assault far from the Pusan Perimeter that UN and Republic of Korea Army forces were desperately defending, the largely undefended city of Inchon was secured after being bombed by UN forces. The battle ended a string of victories by the North Korean Korean People's Army. The subsequent UN recapture of Seoul partially severed the KPA's supply lines in South Korea.\nThe UN and ROK forces were commanded by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur of the United States Army. MacArthur was the driving force behind the operation, overcoming the strong misgivings of more cautious generals to a risky assault over extremely unfavorable terrain.", "items": [{"id": 77990, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/inchon-landing-korea/dQEOZHqkQMun_A", "description": "Gen.

It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. The Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the global economy can decline.\nThe Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929. Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.\nThe Great Depression had devastating effects in both rich and poor countries.

It was fought between the French Union's French Far East Expeditionary Corps and Viet Minh communist revolutionaries.\nThe French began an operation to insert, then support, their soldiers at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, deep in the hills of northwestern Vietnam. The operation's purpose was to cut off Viet Minh supply lines into the neighboring Kingdom of Laos, and draw the Viet Minh into a major confrontation in order to cripple them. The plan was to resupply the French position by air - based on the belief that the Viet Minh had no anti-aircraft capability.

After graduating, he began a career in engineering and construction, but at the onset of World War I he was appointed to lead the 4th Infantry Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt. After heading his troops at Gallipoli, in 1916 he moved to the Western Front, where he was to earn his great renown as a tactician, dedicated to minimising casualties through rigorous training, detailed planning and strong technical and mechanical support of his troops. His book on engineering applied to modern warfare, The Australian Victories in France in 1918, was later submitted to the University of Melbourne as a thesis, on the strength of which Monash was awarded the first doctorate in engineering to be conferred by an Australian university. He was promoted to command the Australian Corps in 1918. He returned from the war with copious British, European and American honours, though he later wrote that \u2018nothing could have been more repugnant to me than the realisation of the dreadful inefficiency of, and the misspent energy of, war\u2019. On his return to civilian life, Monash became General Manager, and later Chairman, of the Victorian State Electricity Commission, overseeing its expansion and modernisation. Involved with a number of public organisations including the Boy Scouts and the University of Melbourne, he remained a much- loved public figure in Victoria until his death; his State funeral was attended by some 300,000 people.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/47Jic8Qv4x84kaWNuPIPnPxUq1ok-yBQp3fK4mAhNw8JBsk6xesBgP_XoIqy", "metadata": ["Title: John Monash", "Creator: James Quinn", "Date Created: 1919", "Physical Dimensions: w64 x h76.5 cm (Support)", "Provenance: National Portrait Gallery, Canberra.

It destroyed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.\nThe fire started in a bakery shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September, and spread rapidly. The use of the major firefighting technique of the time, the creation of firebreaks by means of demolition, was critically delayed due to the indecisiveness of the Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm which defeated such measures.

This painting is a pendant to a view in the opposite direction, towards Westminster, also in the Royal Collection ('London: The Thames from Somerset House Terrace towards Westminster' RCIN 400506). This pair was the last by Canaletto and the only English views to be acquired by Canaletto's great patron, Joseph Smith, who was the British consul in Venice. They are on a Venetian type of canvas with a russet ground rather than the light grey the artist used for most of his English paintings. This suggests that Canaletto painted them when he returned to Venice briefly in 1750-1. The view is not based on the drawing also in the Royal Collection (RCIN 907560), but on a slightly different view now in the Courtauld Institute of Art Gallery. Canaletto adjusted the composition to suit the much grander scale of the painting. The view is taken from the Terrace of Old Somerset House. Its New Gallery facing the river had been built in 1661 for Henrietta Maria, the Queen Mother and was perhaps designed by Inigo Jones. The building was subsequently the home of the Royal Academy, and part of it is now occupied by the Courtauld Institute of Art. The sky line is dominated by St Paul's Cathedral, completed in 1709. Canaletto altered the dome so that it is viewed from slightly below, magnifying its powerful presence. Beyond it stretches a horizon dominated by the steeples of the City churches, largely built by Christopher Wren following the Great Fire of 1666. The Monument to the Fire, erected in 1671-77, is visible to the right, along with Old London Bridge with its houses which were demolished in 1757, and part of the south bank. The pair of views relates not only to Canaletto's Venetian scenes, but also to the long tradition of topographical views of London dating back to the 1600s. Earlier engraved prospects of London were usually printed on several sheets to include the whole riverside from Westminster to the Tower. During the last century artists had chosen to depict the city stretched out in a line from a bird's eye view over the south bank. Canaletto adopted a high viewpoint for his earlier views of the river but brought the viewpoint almost to ground level here. The great curve of the river dominates the composition which also manages to include all the principal features to be seen from the terrace of Somerset House. When the two views are placed side by side they create a long panoramic view of the curve of the river, the equivalent on the Thames of Canaletto's wide-angled views of the Bacino in Venice.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/9qq01NU1YAOyX9q0BaUn6RHCesUQuE8LQ-NpCHMZNGv-lgzEANS1HUzAst__", "metadata": ["Title: London: The Thames from Somerset House Terrace towards the City", "Creator: Canaletto", "Date Created: 1750 - 1751", "Type: Painting", "Rights: Supplied by Royal Collection Trust / (c) HM Queen Elizabeth II 2012", "External Link: http://www.rct.uk/collection/400504", "Medium: Oil on Canvas", "Provenance: Acquired by George III", "Object description: On the left is Somerset House terrace with some large trees and a water-gate with steps, upon which people, including a priest, promenade.

It formally began following the end of the British Mandate for Palestine at midnight on 14 May 1948; the Israeli Declaration of Independence had been issued earlier that day, and a military coalition of Arab states entered the territory of British Palestine in the morning of 15 May.\nThe first deaths of the 1947\u201349 Palestine war occurred on 30 November 1947 during an ambush of two buses carrying Jews. There had been tension and conflict between the Arabs and the Jews, and between each of them and the British forces since the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the 1920 creation of the British Mandate of Palestine. British policies dissatisfied both Arabs and Jews. Arab opposition developed into the 1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine, while the Jewish resistance developed into the 1944\u20131947 Jewish insurgency in Palestine.", "items": [{"id": 47484,

Lying roughly halfway between American Army Airforce bases in the Mariana Islands and the Japanese islands, the military base on Iwo Jima gave the Japanese an ability to send early air raid warnings to the Japanese mainland and launch fighters from its airfields to intercept raids. The American invasion, designated Operation Detachment, had the purpose of capturing the island with its two airfields: South Field and Central Field. The strategic objectives were twofold: the first was to provide an emergency landing strip for battle-damaged B-29s unable to make it back to US air bases in the Marianas Tinian, Saipan, Guam. The second was to provide air fields for fighter escorts, long-range P-51s, to provide fighter coverage to the bombers. The five-week battle saw some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War.\nThe IJA positions on the island were heavily fortified, with a dense network of bunkers, hidden artillery positions, and 18 km of tunnels.", "items": [{"id": 90683, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/iwo-jima-aftermath/3gHgQbZOchfVqA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/8w2D31YveQCQHbmMqVwTasciacj9rFtlClkwerzmObtzzy6hH3RCj-znmg", "metadata": ["Title: Iwo Jima Aftermath", "Date: 1945-03", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Subject Keywords: 1940s, Iwo, Aftermath, Jima, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: W Eugene Smith", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_115920399", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 81719, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/VAHOj8j3eQDYhA", "description": "US Coast Guardsmen assisting a wounded Marine returning from the fight on Iwo Jima.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/NccKmgTOBA_zj_FSlp67DpjgVYhh62jFX5bsf-SvKHcSHsg3oaMWohJK", "metadata": ["Date: 1945-02-25", "Location: Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Wounded, Wars, Wwii, Iwo Jima, American, Volcano Islands, Action, Military, Casualties, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_1207250", "Credits: PICTURE COLLECTION"]}, {"id": 10792, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-and-conflict-wwii/ZwE7e7a-apHX9w", "description": "US Marines unload equipment & supplies onto the sands of Iwo Jima from large Coast Guard & Navy landing craft shortly after troops gained a foothold on the strategically important island.", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/uMt0abPdORIBUbrAFcfux4k5nut4vN0avVvl7GBhikHjvNzYThaekTcCDw", "metadata": ["Title: War And Conflict-Wwii", "Date: 1945-02-19", "Location: Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Beachhead, Landing Operations, Ships, Wars, Wwii, Equipment, Transport, Sea, Volcano Islands, Iwo Jima, Landing Craft, Unloading, Us Armed Forces, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_1199465", "Credits: PICTURE COLLECTION"]}, {"id": 48670, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/iwo-jima-misc/5gHEWgmbjpCwMQ", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/pEGxdHNUJEIz6buS-BW5_JArjClY3UZvIzAcef4qdxcuz5admg9HIWTG6Q", "metadata": ["Title: Iwo Jima Misc.", "Date: 1945-08", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Subject Keywords: 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: George Silk", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_116578559", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 19860, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/EwHC6fyRp8Dp5w", "description": "Pair of American Marines survey the view from atop Mt.

After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the port of Weihaiwei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895.\nThe war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty's attempts to modernize its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty, especially when compared with Japan's successful Meiji Restoration. For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. The humiliating loss of Korea as a tributary state sparked an unprecedented public outcry. Within China, the defeat was a catalyst for a series of political upheavals led by Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei, culminating in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.\nThe war is commonly known in China as the War of Jiawu, referring to the year as named under the traditional sexagenary system of years. In Japan, it is called the Japan\u2013Qing War.", "items": [{"id": 36155, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/our-torpedo-sinks-the-enemy-warship-dingyuan-at-the-battle-of-weihaiwei-artist-kobayashi-kiyochika-publisher-fukuda-kumajiro/FQElff_vQlC_cA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/xaaHu_CcTLaaqEWWnhz2KfkIFx1E-7hZ_d2sN9agn0N1yTDiZ2HWQ89VW6I", "metadata": ["Title: Our torpedo sinks the enemy warship Dingyuan at the Battle of Weihaiwei", "Creator: Artist: Kobayashi Kiyochika, Publisher: Fukuda Kumajiro", "Date Created: 1895", "Location: Japan", "External Link: For more information about this and thousands of other works of art in the Freer|Sackler collection, please visit http://www.asia.si.edu/.", "Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper", "Historical Period: Meiji era", "Credit Line: Robert O.

Villagers in North China had been building resentment against Christian missionaries and the growth of foreign spheres of influence after the Sino-Japanese War of 1895. In a severe drought, violence and murder spread across Shandong and the North China Plain, targetting foreign property, Christian missionaries, and Chinese Christians. In June 1900, Boxer fighters, convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on Beijing with the slogan \"Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners.\" Foreigners and Chinese Christians sought refuge in the Legation Quarter.", "items": [{"id": 37523, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1900-01-boxer-rising-2-folders-1/4wGw8DyBeMcQmQ", "description":

from October 23, 1868 to July 30, 1912. This era represents the first half of the Empire of Japan, during which period the Japanese people moved from being an isolated feudal society at risk of colonization by Western powers to the new paradigm of a modern, industrialized nation state and emergent great power, influenced by Western scientific, technological, philosophical, political, legal, and aesthetic ideas. As a result of such wholesale adoption of radically different ideas, the changes to Japan were profound, and affected its social structure, internal politics, economy, military, and foreign relations. The period corresponded to the reign of Emperor Meiji. It was preceded by the Kei\u014d era and was succeeded by the Taish\u014d era, upon the accession of Emperor Taish\u014d.\nTo convert any Gregorian calendar year between 1868 and 1912 to Japanese calendar year in Meiji era, 1867 needs to be subtracted from the year in question.", "items": [{"id": 56765, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/portrait-of-western-woman-fujishima-takeji/ogEzMMHnD3fxTQ", "description": "Born in Kagoshima, FUJISHIMA Takeji started studying Japanese painting but then moved to Tokyo to study Western painting, entering the Gajuku Seikokan School where he studied under YAMAMOTO Hosui.

The picture shown here was painted while he was living in Europe. Traveling to both France and Italy, he studied in Italy under Carolus-Duran who excelled at portraiture. He also turned his hand to book covers and binding.

Biafra represented nationalist aspirations of the Igbo people, whose leadership felt they could no longer coexist with the Northern-dominated federal government. The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonization of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included ethno-religious violence and anti-Igbo pogroms in Northern Nigeria, a military coup, a counter-coup and persecution of Igbo living in Northern Nigeria. Control over the lucrative oil production in the Niger Delta also played a vital strategic role.\nWithin a year, the Federal Government troops surrounded Biafra, capturing coastal oil facilities and the city of Port Harcourt.

It was part of the wider Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The first and second wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The wars also involved the Scottish Covenanters and Irish Confederates. The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.\nUnlike other civil wars in England, which were mainly fought over who should rule, these conflicts were also concerned with how the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland should be governed. The outcome was threefold: the trial and the execution of Charles I; the exile of his son, Charles II; and the replacement of English monarchy with the Commonwealth of England, which from 1653 unified the British Isles under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell and briefly his son Richard.", "items": [{"id": 25437, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/and-when-did-you-last-see-your-father-william-frederick-yeames/7QH3jR1ZzNIXpg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/iLTWDQOY2M-aA_rdbt4-mWgT8UHqHQ_S1hLg7f_UCLRVGrp7zRanzgSJ8OE", "metadata": []}, {"id": 28723, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-eve-of-the-battle-of-edge-hill-1642-charles-landseer/XQGUNMAEYfaXKw", "description": "The subject of this painting is a council of war in the Royalist camp the day before the first battle of the English Civil War.

Sixty-seven countries participated in IGY projects, although one notable exception was the mainland People's Republic of China, which was protesting against the participation of the Republic of China. East and West agreed to nominate the Belgian Marcel Nicolet as secretary general of the associated international organization.\nThe IGY encompassed eleven Earth sciences: aurora and airglow, cosmic rays, geomagnetism, gravity, ionospheric physics, longitude and latitude determinations, meteorology, oceanography, seismology, and solar activity. The timing of the IGY was particularly suited for studying some of these phenomena, since it covered the peak of solar cycle 19.\nBoth the Soviet Union and the U.S. launched artificial satellites for this event; the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, launched on October 4, 1957, was the first successful artificial satellite.", "items": [{"id": 75173, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/coronograph-at-sacramento-peak-n-m-for-geophysical-year-story/6AElva9NX452Gg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/fEaJb5HcYXG1cOfSvxb1odAOeiws2ZYFynTUMHeYdyVtaVWU03qMqKH_GA", "metadata": ["Title: Coronograph At Sacramento Peak, N.M.

The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 1,033,000 Iraqis were killed in the first three to four years of conflict. US troops were officially withdrawn in 2011. The U.S. became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the armed conflict continue. The invasion occurred as part of the George W. Bush administration's War on Terror following the September 11 attacks despite no connection of the latter to Iraq.\nIn October 2002, Congress granted President Bush the power to decide whether to launch any military attack against Iraq. The Iraq War began on 20 March 2003, when the U.S., joined by the U.K. and several coalition allies, launched a \"shock and awe\" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as coalition forces swept through the country.", "items": [{"id": 40330, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/YgGF9exWZHK_xA", "description": "TIME cover 03-15-2004 Special Report: Iraq One Year Later; Looking for a Way Out.

Embedded on either side in the \ufb01eld of shredded stars-and-stripes are two figures, one black and the other white, which serve as icons for racial difference and human divisiveness. Created just after the start of the Iraq War, the painting also conjures up the end-game horror of an unchecked quest for domination and power as the flag\u2019s bands of patriotic red and white turn into festoons of bloody bandages on a gory battle\ufb01eld. Like the endless line of flag-draped coffins that signal the return home of dead soldiers, the bodies of Dial\u2019s two figures are bound together within the same striped shroud. Now brothers of the same cloth, they lie side by side on a floating ground made from countless mattress coils. It is Dial\u2019s punning signifier for one final moralism: We have created a hard bed for ourselves, and the only hope and recourse for humanity is the realization that we must find a way to lie in it together.", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/h3HBOLzTiBKOpTkiWLz7Cd8n4qNUPuXztI2134xbrqfHWvSHQug26myX3xLqP3WR7P0", "metadata": ["Title: Don't Matter How Raggly the Flag, It Still Got to Tie Us Together", "Creator: Thornton Dial", "Creator Lifespan: 1928/2016", "Creator Nationality: American", "Creator Gender: Male", "Creator Death Place: McCalla, Alabama", "Creator Birth Place: Emelle, Alabama", "Date Created: 2003", "Physical Location: Indianapolis Museum of Art, Museum purchase and gift of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation", "Location Created: McCalla, Alabama", "Physical Dimensions: 71 x 114 x 8 in.

In this epic painting, which measures over ten feet long, Dial captures the carnage of human conflict, a barbed-wire world mangled and tangled in the wake of its own self-destruction. Hidden within the scene are tiny, gruesome dramas of slaughter and death, as everywhere the gray and green spots of military camouflage are joined by patternings of red, white and blue, ironic signifiers for the American dream of freedom and democracy that turn, at times, into splatters of blood. Finally, hovering above it all are two metal bars with flag-like stripes that form the patriotic V for victory, the delusional rhetoric of triumph etched atop the wreckage of war. Dial\u2019s \"Victory in Iraq\" is a true wartime junk heap, filled with the burnt and crumbling detritus of battle, as well as with the exploded myths of political self-deception. Produced at a time when the world had begun to question the justifications for one country\u2019s desire to topple another, it reeks not only with the scent of a bombed and scorched landscape but with suspicions of public deception and obfuscation. Nearly concealed from sight within Dial\u2019s glut of gloomy debris is the remnant of a can of Halvoline motor oil, the reminder of a persistent rumor about other, undisclosed motives behind the U.S. invasion. Still, beyond such clues, it is difficult to know exactly where Dial stands on the politics of the conflict. When asked, he alludes to a scriptural passage on the inevitability of human aggression in which Christ warns: \u201cAnd ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye not be troubled: for all these things must come to pass . . . .\u201d", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/UBI63MrYm_v4KUD7NKUq1ZtNzpUZrc45acaHTaGGNexgxlYsZnIzFxB_huSTEDs0dG8", "metadata": ["Title: Victory in Iraq", "Creator: Thornton Dial", "Creator Lifespan: 1928/2016", "Creator Nationality: American", "Creator Gender: Male", "Creator Death Place: McCalla, Alabama", "Creator Birth Place: Emelle, Alabama", "Date Created: 2004", "Physical Location: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gift of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation", "Location Created: McCalla, Alabama", "Physical Dimensions: 83 1/2 x 135 x 16 1/2 in.

The battle was the longest of the First World War and took place on the hills north of Verdun-sur-Meuse. The German 5th Army attacked the defences of the Fortified Region of Verdun and those of the French Second Army on the right bank of the Meuse. Using the experience of the Second Battle of Champagne in 1915, the Germans planned to capture the Meuse Heights, an excellent defensive position with good observation for artillery-fire on Verdun. The Germans hoped that the French would commit their strategic reserve to recapture the position and suffer catastrophic losses at little cost to the Germans.\nPoor weather delayed the beginning of the attack until 21 February but the Germans captured Fort Douaumont in the first three days. The advance then slowed for several days, despite inflicting many French casualties. By 6 March, \u200b20 \u00b9\u2044\u2082 French divisions were in the RFV and a more extensive defence in depth had been constructed.

The Katipunan, led by Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio, began to influence much of the Philippines. During a mass gathering in Caloocan, the leaders of the Katipunan organized themselves into a revolutionary government, named the newly established government \"Haring Bayang Katagalugan\", and openly declared a nationwide armed revolution. Bonifacio called for an attack on the capital city of Manila. This attack failed; however, the surrounding provinces began to revolt. In particular, rebels in Cavite led by Mariano \u00c1lvarez and Baldomero Aguinaldo won early major victories. A power struggle among the revolutionaries led to a schism among Katipunan leadership followed by Andres Bonifacio's execution in 1897.

Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista read the Declaration of Philippine Independence, which he himself had penned. Patterned after the American Declaration, it invoked the protection of God in heaven and \u201cthe Mightly and Humane North American Nation\u201d on earth, dissolved all bonds between Spain and the Philippines, and proclaimed the right of the new republic to exercise all the attributes of a sovereign nation-state.Among the throng that witnessed the independence proclamation was Apolinario Mabini, a paralytic who had to be brought to Cavite in a hammock. He arrived on that very day, 12 June, to become Aguinaldo\u2019s chief adviser on political and constitutional matters. Mabini immediately pointed out the grave implications of the absence of any written pledge of American support for Philippine independence. He opposed the unilateral declaration of 12 June, regarding it as politically unwise in view of America\u2019s apparent intention to keep the Philippines. Mabini advised Aguinaldo to form and consolidate a competent government that would win recognition from foreign powers, and thus neutralize any American moves against it.

From there, the Katipuneros moved to Barrio Kangkong and eventually, to Barrio Pugadlawin. At Pugadlawin, Bonifacio asked his men whether they were prepared to fight to the end. They all responded in the affirmative. Bonifacio then urged everyone to tear up his or her tax certificate (the infamous cedula personal), a symbolic gesture signifying the end of servitude to Spain.

The Eastern Front, as the site of nearly all extermination camps, death marches, ghettos, and the majority of pogroms, was central to the Holocaust.

Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the First Balkan War. In the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria fought against all four original combatants of the first war along with facing a surprise attack from Romania from the north. The Ottoman Empire lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples. The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus served as a \"prelude to the First World War\".\nBy the early 20th century, Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia had achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire, but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule. In 1912, these countries formed the Balkan League. The First Balkan War began on 8 October 1912, when the League member states attacked the Ottoman Empire, and ended eight months later with the signing of the Treaty of London on 30 May 1913.", "items": [{"id": 60869, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/sanitary-bag/kgGgfWt8h2FrRg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/8kVoNPC0u-aIYRSAm0Bj0HNpJFJfqKst-pJ9KTeeirfruaCwwSnPLwAwwt2t", "metadata": []}, {"id": 10856, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/war-1912-13-2nd-bulgarian-war/2wFQUOCkgZz6pg", "description": "War 1912-13 2nd Bulgarian War", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/rLi1fDfE8JKHQDxd7g346yy8gEPwEJq41lJnChzziEQlUOyyr-h7se1JJg", "metadata": ["Title: War 1912-13 2Nd Bulgarian War", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_111412383", "Credits: Mansell", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 85875, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/army-supply-train-hristo-stanchev/zwHywRxswhpe4Q", "description": "Army supply train.

It included worker strikes, peasant unrest, and military mutinies. It led to constitutional reform, including the establishment of the State Duma, the multi-party system, and the Russian Constitution of 1906.\nThe 1905 revolution was spurred by the Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, which ended in the same year, but also by the growing realization by a variety of sectors of society of the need for reform. Politicians such as Sergei Witte had failed to accomplish this. While the Tsar managed to keep his rule, the events foreshadowed those of the Russian revolutions in 1917, which resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy, execution of the imperial family, and creation of the Soviet Union by the Bolsheviks.\nSome historians contend that the 1905 revolution set the stage for the 1917 Russian Revolutions, and enabled Bolshevism to emerge as a distinct political movement in Russia, although it was still a minority.", "items": [{"id": 31565, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/his-russia-1905/pQEcn2RJ4q6BvA", "description": "His Russia

was a gold rush that began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought approximately 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and the sudden population increase allowed California to go rapidly to statehood, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population's decline from disease, starvation and the California Genocide. By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory, to having one of its first two U.S. Senators, John C. Fr\u00e9mont, selected to be the first presidential nominee for the new Republican Party, in 1856.\nThe effects of the Gold Rush were substantial. Whole indigenous societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by the gold-seekers, called \"forty-niners\". Outside of California, the first to arrive were from Oregon, the Sandwich Islands, and Latin America in late 1848.", "items": [{"id": 81671, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-bullion-mine-virginia-city-nevada-carleton-watkins/egHKOaoRPTHRTQ", "description": "Most of the miners in this rugged settlement took special care to dress for their portrait, appearing in their best white shirts and black jackets.

While he painted each of the moths from face on, through the blurring of the backs of their wings he succeeded in creating an image of dancing moths. The expression of the flames traces back to the flame depiction seen in Buddhist paintings and handscrolls, but his depiction of the tips of the flames as coiling forms is based on his observation of actual flames. The deep darkness of the background, of which he himself said, \"If asked to paint it again, it is a color I could not achieve a second time,\" is clearly a subtle tone that he achieved after much trial and error. For Gyosh\u00fb this work was a fusion of classical style and actual observation, all melded in a higher dimension, and thus representative of the Taish\u00f4 period's trends and awareness of realism and symbolism.", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/5LSnSB1h46oOlsawtFNDjG4cxydRlMruyzNgOlZMBq2nKzQwm1ajqq3LaytB", "metadata": ["Title: Dancing in the Flames (Important Cultural Property)", "Date Created: 1925", "Location Created: Tokyo, Japan", "\u6750\u8cea\u30fb\u6280\u6cd5\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\uff09: \u7d79\u672c\u30fb\u5f69\u8272\u30fb\u984d(1\u9762)", "\u4f5c\u5bb6\u540d\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\uff09: \u901f\u6c34\u5fa1\u821f", "\u4f5c\u54c1\u540d(\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\uff09: \u708e\u821e\u3010\u91cd\u8981\u6587\u5316\u8ca1\u3011", "Physical Dimensions: w538 x h1203 mm", "Painter: Hayami Gyosh\u016b", "Type: Nihonga (Modern Japanese Paintings)", "Rights: Yamatane Museum of Art, Japan, \u00a9 Yamatane Museum of Art, 2013", "Medium: Color on Silk"]}, {"id": 71033, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/doshisha-seminary/qwE5ely_3qk_aQ", "description": "Clerk house from the end of Meiji period to the early Taisho period.

Learning of the \u2018Shirakaba\u2019 literature and art magazine, he struck up a friendship with the artists of the Shirakaba School, becoming very impressed with the work of the Neo-Impressionists. In 1912 he helped form the Fyuzankai (Fusain Society). After the Fyuzankai was disbanded, he became influenced by the work of D\u00fcrer and the Northern Renaissance painters, developing his own form of realism painting. From 1915 to 1922 he presided over the Sodo-sha Fine Arts Society, producing works such as \u2018Kiritoshi no Shasei\u2019 (Road Cut Through a Hill), \u2018Reiko-zo\u2019 (Portrait of Reiko) and numerous mysterious-seeming still-lifes.\nIn 1916 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and forced to live quietly. When his medical treatment prevented him from venturing out to sketch, he concentrated on still-life painting. In 1917 he moved to Kugenuma in Kanagawa Prefecture. The work shown here was produced when he was living in Kugenuma and an entry in his diary for June 1920 would appear to refer it.

The operation was opposed by German forces in the area of Anzio and Nettuno.\nThe operation was initially commanded by Major General John P. Lucas, of the U.S. Army, commanding U.S. VI Corps with the intention being to outflank German forces at the Winter Line and enable an attack on Rome.\nThe success of an amphibious landing at that location, in a basin consisting substantially of reclaimed marshland and surrounded by mountains, depended on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could build up strength and move inland relative to the reaction time and strength of the defenders. Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders. Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, understood that risk, but he did not pass on his appreciation of the situation to his subordinate, Lucas, who preferred to take time to entrench against an expected counterattack.", "items": [{"id": 18596, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/bwEk9qrXGX2GGA", "description": "American soldiers relaxing aboard a docked LST w. their mascot \"Axis Sally\", a waterfront statue adorned w. a combat helmet, which was \"liberated\" during the ongoing battle for control of the Anzio beachhead area.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/G_7oTq-pKG-QKGyjiytxfDkXW9RiVKMLKYcgDMVoXjE5rNCmoaX-2fqSJQ", "metadata": ["Date: 1944-02", "Location: Anzio, Italy", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Wwii, Recreation, Italy, Wars, Lounging, Anzio, Action, Allied, Us Armed Forces, Art, Loot, Mascots, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: George Silk", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_600745", "Credits: LIFE", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 67772, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/dQHIA7z5glhVvw", "description": "Bomb shattered bridge spanning the Mussolini Canal has been replaced by temporary span during the fight for control of Anzio beachhead area.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/2Z4jwlgnqz2c4DuzU4J52xqGoIjjVveDoEI21SpUosIVYF5OVaZS9EwKNA", "metadata": ["Date: 1944", "Location: Anzio, Italy", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Wwii, Battlefields, Italy, Anzio, Ruins, Wars, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: George Silk", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_600708", "Credits: LIFE", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 42002, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/wAHvKcrsElzUFg", "description": "Amid piled rubble of war, American troops disembark from a docked LST landing craft to begin the long Allied campaign to push German troops from the Italian mainland.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/bmbSe3FytXyeKesxY930BOzkgV0lCj0sJoaGqzr2b1FTIEMRJOM2PIuV", "metadata": ["Date: 1944", "Location: Anzio, Italy", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Disembarkations, Beachhead, Landing Operations, Italy, Wars, Anzio, Action, Sea, Wwii, Transport, Armed Forces, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: George Silk", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_600724", "Credits: LIFE", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 11574, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/sgFRhn9wCFfRJw", "description": "Battle scarred main road from Anzio to Rome littered w. wrecked Allied armor, including an M10 tank destroyer (L) and Sherman M4 tanks, a result of battle between German and Allied forces fighting for control of the Anzio beachhead area.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/I8BmYd7tSfkBOpZY3DRYy1-XMuaMBZJKEBJSonSw350EpZuRFWJZxkuWjw", "metadata": ["Date: 1944-02", "Location: Anzio, Italy", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Anzio, Battlefields, Italy, Wars, Wwii, Equipment, American, Captured Or Destroyed, Tanks, Ruins, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: George Silk", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_600713", "Credits: LIFE", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 59253, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/kgGmjLXyq42Reg", "description": "American amphibious DUK vehicles heading out to unload cargo from ship waiting offshore during the landings at Anzio.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/AAiu24PHZiSDKjLB1vliSRBjrH_g6GVZuVhyNhHQ62-TGurgt6S_zj3T", "metadata": ["Date: 1944", "Location: Anzio, Italy", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Action, Amphibious, Beachhead, Landing Operations, Italy, Trucks, Wars, Anzio, Equipment, Wwii, Us Armed Forces, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: George Silk", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_600725", "Credits: LIFE", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 75962, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/stephen-m-messineo/PgEwOxSG_3M2iA", "description": "Honored Italian-American soldier Stephen M.

Mandate. It is the first war of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict and the broader Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. During this war, the British Empire withdrew from Mandate Palestine, which had been part of the Ottoman Empire until 1917. The war culminated in the establishment of the State of Israel by the Jews, and saw a complete demographic transformation of the territory the Jews occupied, with the displacement of around 700,000 Palestinian Arabs and the destruction of most of their urban areas. Many Palestinian Arabs ended up stateless, displaced either to the Palestinian territories captured by Egypt and Jordan or to the surrounding Arab states; many of them, as well as their descendants, remain stateless and in refugee camps.", "items": [{"id": 50103, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/lgG4xWVi51jNPA", "description": "Jewish soldier sitting between two members of the Arab

The fair, visited by nearly 50 million, displayed many technological innovations, including the Grande Roue de Paris Ferris wheel, the moving sidewalk, diesel engines, talking films, escalators, and the telegraphone. It also brought international attention to the Art Nouveau style. Additionally, it showcased France as a major colonial power through numerous pavilions built on the hill of the Trocadero Palace.

Rivera executed this metaphorically charged portrait, whose two planes display a strong stylistic contrast with each other, in 1913. The static, elongated, elegantly dressed protagonist stands out in the foreground, standing on a sort of red-railed balcony that distances him from, and raises him above the urban scene in the background i.e. the modern Paris of the time, with a train, factories whose chimneys billow forth clouds of smoke that give an impression of movement, urban buildings depicted in a Cubist style, a futuristically rapid train and, behind everything, a wheel of fortune spinning so dizzily that its spokes are blurred. The aforesaid wheel of fortune, reminiscent of the one built for the 1900 Paris Universal Exhibition, symbolizes technological progress. Rivera succeeded in connecting these two spaces, depicted in different styles, by using perspective to provide a visual link between the protagonist's forefinger and the center of the wheel of fortune, suggesting that man, from a higher plane and acting as a demiurge, directs and promotes progress. Portrait of Adolfo Best Maugard, (a.k.a. Young Man on the Balcony), was shown at the Paris Salon des Ind\u00e9pendents in 1913, and made known to Mexicans, via a photograph in the El Universal Ilustrado magazine, on the 24th of May, 1918. Having belonged to a private collection, this piece has formed part of the MUNAL collection since 1983, thanks to a generous donation in the will of Mr. Arturo Arn\u00e1iz y Freg.", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/2wvMVwujbq3ej9g5HN3LwwInQXbm5gI7DP80Yc-YcG0jA2oDrfqAMxhSEIHk", "metadata": ["Title: Portrait of Adolfo Best Maugard", "Date Created: 1913", "painter: Diego Rivera", "Provenance: private collection, 1983", "Physical Dimensions: w1615 x h2275 mm (complete)", "Original Spanish object note: Diego Rivera coincidi\u00f3 en Par\u00eds con Adolfo Best Maugard, quien se encontraba en Europa desde 1912 para realizar copias de objetos arqueol\u00f3gicos mexicanos en museos de aquellas tierras por encargo de la Secretar\u00eda de Instrucci\u00f3n P\u00fablica y Bellas Artes. Rivera realiz\u00f3 su retrato de contenido metaf\u00f3rico hacia 1913, el cual muestra un fuerte contraste estil\u00edstico entre los dos planos que lo conforman. En el primero destaca la figura est\u00e1tica, alargada y elegantemente ataviada del protagonista, quien se sit\u00faa en una especie de balc\u00f3n cercado por un pretil rojo que lo aleja y coloca por encima del paisaje urbano del fondo. En confrontaci\u00f3n, la escena del segundo plano muestra la modernidad de la urbe parisina de aquel tiempo. El tren y los espacios fabriles: chimeneas que arrojan nubes de humo creando sensaci\u00f3n de movimiento, el cubismo presente en la composici\u00f3n de las edificaciones citadinas y el futurismo en la velocidad del ferrocarril y en la rueda de la fortuna del fondo, que gira vertiginosamente difuminando sus radios. La inclusi\u00f3n de la rueda representa el s\u00edmbolo de una herramienta que posibilit\u00f3 el avance tecnol\u00f3gico de la humanidad, y recuerda aquella construida para la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de 1900 en Par\u00eds. Rivera logr\u00f3 la conjunci\u00f3n de dos espacios trabajados en estilos diferentes gracias al manejo de la perspectiva, al unir visualmente el dedo \u00edndice del protagonista con el centro de la rueda de la fortuna. Imagen en la que el hombre, desde un estrato superior y a manera de demiurgo, sostiene y da impulso al progreso.

The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably Homer's Iliad. The core of the Iliad describes a period of four days and two nights in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the war's heroes. Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments. Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid.\nThe ancient Greeks believed that Troy was located near the Dardanelles and that the Trojan War was a historical event of the 13th or 12th century BC, but by the mid-19th century AD, both the war and the city were widely seen as non-historical. In 1868, however, the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert, who convinced Schliemann that Troy was a real city at what is now Hisarlik in Turkey.", "items": [{"id": 95727, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/black-figure-neck-amphora/fQGtKg_3y_J7Bw", "description": "Achilles and Ajax, two great heroes of the Trojan War, play a board game on this Athenian black-figure amphora.

This depiction of Ajax and Achilles gaming was especially popular in Athenian art in the late 500s B.C.; over 150 surviving vases show the scene. Why was this image so popular? Some scholars have argued that it was politically motivated. They interpret this scene as a mythical parallel for the tyrant Peisistratos's return from exile, when he was able to regain power because the Athenian army was unprepared for battle. If so, then these vases would be anti-Peisistratid propaganda, alerting Athenians to the importance of vigilance by reminding them of the consequences of their recent failure. The back of the vase shows a warrior departing for battle, standing between two old men.

It depicts a scene from the Trojan War, which we know from the inscriptions that identify the two characters: Achilles is tending to his friend Patroclus, whose left arm has been injured by an arrow. He turns his head away with a grimace of pain while his more youthful friend bandages his wound. Achilles is equipped with helmet and armour, which underlines how defenceless Patroclus is. He is only wearing the cap that served as lining under a metal helmet. The shoulder plates of his armour are open and his seated position on his shield, his genitals in full view, epitomises his vulnerability by revealing his weakest point where he later receives the fatal blow from Hector. The scene of this apparently harmless injury actually predicts the death of Patroclus and points to the end of Achilles who, despite a warning prophecy, enters battle to avenge the death of his friend where he too meets his tragic fate, dying at a young age. A recent interpretation suggests that the scene also invokes the homoerotic relationship between the two heroes, a further aspect that the user of the cup could identify with: in the late Archaic period \u2013 that is in the era of the symposium \u2013 the relationship between an older lover (erastes) and a younger beloved (eromenos) was a widespread phenomenon in Athenian society. The world of the Olympian gods is depicted on the outside of the bowl. They are gathered around the ruling couple Zeus and Hera and are pouring wine on the ground from ornate offering bowls as a sign of their divinity. Within this closed circle \u2013 those sitting down take no notice of new arrivals \u2013 Herakles is being introduced by his half-brothers and sister Hermes, Apollo and Athena. In recognition of his difficult life and painful death, he is being admitted into the world of the gods as the son of Zeus. Both scenes would have been considered appropriate for grave goods so it is no surprise that the bowl was found in a tomb in Etruscan Vulci. However, it was made in Athens and signed with pride by the potter Sosias on the base. The original name of the talented painter who worked with the potter in Antiquity is unfortunately not known. Archaeologists have since named him the Sosias Painter after this piece in Berlin.", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/EkItmrERNYDlF6821M6JRVMy9qqUDo7h1T73TzVVZTf3dAmZvqYnlUYyAmfl", "metadata": ["Title: Achilles bandaging Patroklos", "Creator: Unknown", "Date Created: -500", "Location: Vulci", "Physical Dimensions: h10 cm", "Type: Cup", "Medium: Clay", "Object acquired: Acquired in 1831", "Inv.-No.: F 2278", "ISIL-No.: DE-MUS-814319", "External link: Altes Museum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin", "Copyrights: Text: \u00a9 Verlag Philipp von Zabern / Antikensammlung, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin / Martin Maischberger and Agnes Schwarzmaier || Photo: \u00a9 b p k - || Photo Agency / Antikensammlung, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin / Johannes Laurentius", "Collection: Antikensammlung, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Preu\u00dfischer Kulturbesitz"]}, {"id": 97540, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/attic-black-figure-neck-amphora-leagros-group/TgHgiLxvKKVpZw", "description": "Two warriors sit playing a board game, while the goddess Athena stands in front of the board and gestures. The warriors have their armor and weapons ready, as if just pausing during a break in the conflict. Based on similar scenes with inscriptions, the two warriors can be identified as Ajax and Achilles, the leading men in the Greek army. This scene was very popular in Athenian vase-painting of the late 500s B.C. and was a favorite of the painters in the Leagros Group. Some scholars believe that this mythological scene also served as a contemporary political parable on the value of staying alert, since the tyrant Peisistratos had been able to take control of the city of Athens while the army was distracted. The back of the vase depicts three hoplites, or warriors, in a line. Such files of hoplites are rather unusual in vase-painting, and this depiction may have been meant to relate to the scene on the front of the vase.

This red-figure amphora features a refined painting. The red-figure technique was developed around 530 B.C. Before that time vases were black-figured, the painting being done in black-colouring clay on a red background.\nWith this new technique it was the opposite: the space outside the outlined decoration was done in black, leaving the figures red. Thus it became possible to add certain refinements with a brush. The figures become more flexible and their clothes are rendered inmore detail. Black-figure pottery usually features stiff figures in silhouette. In red-figure pottery they are turned towards the beholder and sometimes done in three quarters, possessing more depth.\nOn the front of the vase we see a picture of the combat between Achilles (left) and Memnon (right) during the Trojan war. The scene is described in Homer\u2019s Iliad. Above the scene, the heroes\u2019mothers are watching the combat, while the god Hermes is weighing the souls on a pair of scales, which tip the wrong way for Memnon.

He protects his body with a round shield and his elevated right hand is poised to throw the lance it holds. The cheek guards of the helmet are turned up which was not customary at the time, no doubt artistic licence taken by the sculptor to show off the face more clearly. The statue is not fully finished. Two workers, one with the characteristic leather cap of the smith, smooth the surface with scrapers. A second statue of an athlete with raised arms is lying down on a bed of sand or clay. An assistant is holding onto one of the arms and is aiming carefully towards the right hand with his hammer. A line on the wrist shows that the different parts were cast separately and have not yet been properly joined. The head of the statue still has to be mounted and lies on the floor between the legs of the artisan. A third group of artisans are busy with the kiln, which has a very tall chimney. A young man behind the kiln stokes the fire with a bellows. No doubt, they are heating the solder in the fire to join the parts of the reclining statue. Workshops of this kind were found all over the potters\u2019 quarter or Kerameikos in Athens. The vase painters would have been familiar with the work that went on there from their own observations. Nevertheless, there are some things, for instance the kiln, which have been altered to suit artistic conventions. Social views are also reflected in the details. For instance, the fact that the worker sitting at the kiln is posed in such a way that his genitals can be seen would not have been socially acceptable \u2013 such a pose was only used to portray slaves or satyrs. Two men leaning on a staff and observing the goings on stand out from the workers. They are probably not the owners of the workshop but simply citizens of Athens who have stopped by the workshop on their way to the palaestra \u2013 or wrestling school. Evidence to support this hypothesis is provided by the sports equipment that is hanging up, namely oil vials and the strigil, which was used to scrape the mix of oil and sand off the skin after wrestling.", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/mX2Evn89fokpWDg6Wwtx97OqmTOEhBIMux1ILAeYon5NJiSQ-7442PstSPY", "metadata": ["Title: A foundry of bronzeworkers", "Creator: Unknown", "Date Created: -490/-480", "Location: Vulci", "Physical Dimensions: h30,5 cm", "Type: Bowl", "Medium: Clay", "Object acquired: Acquired through von Bunsen in 1837.", "Inv.-No.: F 2294", "ISIL-No.: DE-MUS-814319", "External link: Altes Museum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin", "Copyrights: Text: \u00a9 Verlag Philipp von Zabern / Antikensammlung, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin / Gerhard Zimmer || Photo: \u00a9 b p k - || Photo Agency / Antikensammlung, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin / Johannes Laurentius", "Collection: Antikensammlung, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Preu\u00dfischer Kulturbesitz"]}, {"id": 80784, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/battle-before-a-walled-city-unknown/FAHP0S3vxjmlkw", "description": "Following from left to right, the episodes in this battle, identified as the siege of Troy, unfold.

In 1874, Sir Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to effect such plans. Among the obstacles were the armed independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand.\nFrere, on his own initiative, sent a deliberately provocative, untenable ultimatum on 11 December 1878 to the Zulu king Cetshwayo, and upon its rejection sent Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand. The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an opening victory of the Zulu at the Battle of Isandlwana, followed by the defeat of a large Zulu army at Rorke's Drift by a small British force.

Rorke's Drift was a small outpost on the banks of the Buffalo River in Natal Province. A large Zulu force, having slaughtered around 900 troops and native levies at nearby Isandlhwana, set upon the eighty soldiers of the Warwickshire Regiment stationed at Rorke's Drift. The defenders managed to hold off their attackers, usually characterised as an undisciplined horde, in a bloody hand-to-hand battle of Boys' Own proportions.

It took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916 on both sides of the upper reaches of the River Somme in France. The battle was intended to hasten a victory for the Allies. More than three million men fought in the battle and one million men were wounded or killed, making it one of the deadliest battles in human history.\nThe French and British had committed themselves to an offensive on the Somme during the Chantilly Conference in December 1915. The Allies agreed upon a strategy of combined offensives against the Central Powers in 1916 by the French, Russian, British and Italian armies, with the Somme offensive as the Franco-British contribution. Initial plans called for the French army to undertake the main part of the Somme offensive, supported on the northern flank by the Fourth Army of the British Expeditionary Force.", "items": [{"id": 43271, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/nQEh5v9dq36aNA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/VfcuDBcRS1pUh9tg_epJp1OOjy7fk9chPpE4tp5lI77HJgATH0dmmg-o", "metadata": []}, {"id": 91032, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/zonnebeke-sir-william-orpen/DAG_Evr5TvN3Yg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/7hbpYm_Lj_WB0N9RlsSWDxMshbN-rD8JM9-xdUZU5KFsbvMQNY6GMWDVCZlJnA", "metadata": []}, {"id": 28560, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/deutsche-soldaten-auf-einem-sturmpanzerwagen-a-7-v-in-roye-an-der-somme/yAGtGF1t7NUpkw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/L1KgcHKt4mZheIe1TOqUB01L3ClDqV7-VRc92FeY19f70S1EkCwFPhRBC-HU", "metadata": []}, {"id": 67015, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/4wGKz_1IAiXcxg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/3oA9j5P5QHAjgNRXqL2N3ZUfYQt9LfU67nU9n-P9q57WuWbk1XmE6OKNWUA", "metadata": []}, {"id": 92200, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/QQFBgoSKKYpVAQ", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/yDidt-9Y4hh9OAtGwR-Z-ya8QwjmSp1sSer44OwaDOzUPiFb0Q5ocYJtTA", "metadata": []}, {"id": 34257, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/dead-germans-in-a-trench-orpen-william-sir-ra/NQEwQRucOTSGeg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/zCHfKNxNttnto3aadozsDWBovJyuo-7ARhEf-yRhX7-Ck-a8tis1qobod8uv", "metadata": []}, {"id": 55743, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/OgHrw49U8yOxFw", "description": "French soldiers advancing towards the front during the Battles of the Somme.", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/rxhmCm52lhFjpyiA3YOx1eIb7vslRoa57UZfPsJx1_sKSKOc47Cn3IUe0A", "metadata": ["Location: France", "Physical Dimensions: COLOR PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Land, Action, France, Wwi, Wars, 1916", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_1180728", "Credits: MANSELL COLLECTION"]}, {"id": 58974, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/coming-out-on-the-somme-will-dyson/3wEcPgD5UaQSKA", "description": "Will Dyson (1880\u20131938) was a cartoonist and writer who became Australia\u2019s first official war artist.

On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities.\nThe conflict was a major episode in the protracted dispute over the territories' sovereignty. Argentina asserted that the islands are Argentine territory, and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory.

The clouds are typical of tropical areas both nearby and away from tropical cyclones. Observations were taken at 1 p.m. EDT (5 p.m. UTC) on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2017, as Irma approached the Caribbean islands and was just becoming a powerful Category 5 storm. Each cylinder represents a volume of cloud detected by AIRS. The oval cylinder ends represent a region viewed by AIRS, with the oval sizes adjusted to reflect the proportion of clouds filling the area viewed. The largest ovals are about 30 miles (45 kilometers) across. The height of the cylinders indicates the cloud thickness, with thickest clouds reaching down to the surface. The vertical scale is exaggerated 15 times. Colors represent temperatures at the tops of the clouds. The perspective views the storm diagonally from above with an initial view toward the north-northwest, with the perspective rotating clockwise for a full circle. The area depicted is about 1,000 miles by 800 miles across (1,600 by 1,300 kilometers). At the start of the loop, North America is seen at the top of the image, and coastal Venezuela at the lower right. In the initial perspective, cirrus clouds (thin and blue), associated with flow outward from the top of the hurricane, overlie warmer (pink and red) shallow clouds. About five seconds into the loop, the deep clouds in the middle of Irma are easily seen. The most dangerous parts of Irma are within the region of high and cold (blue), thick clouds surrounding the central eye. The clouds are cold because they are carried to high, cold altitudes by vigorous thunderstorms within the hurricane. The eye itself is nearly cloud free, but the few clouds within it are low and warm. As the perspective shift toward the south-southeast around seven seconds into the loop, another storm system well north of Irma can be seen. It contains high, thick clouds, with more cirrus carried outward over shallow clouds. At about nine seconds, more outflow from Irma is seen, with high, thin clouds over shallow clouds once again apparent. Shortly afterward when the view is toward the southwest, yet more deep clouds and their outflowing cirrus clouds are apparent. This image depicts many of the clouds typical of the tropics even when cyclones are not present: high, cold thunderstorms pushing cirrus clouds over nearby regions containing many warm, shallow clouds. The animation also shows the structure typical of tropical cyclones around the world: very strong thunderstorms lifting clouds into cold parts of the atmosphere, with strong outflow at upper levels carrying cirrus clouds away from the storm center, and the storm organized symmetrically around a central eye.", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ll9YPuzlx-JbVEhDj4OA6KP8tBOq2b5bwpi9Sc2cpk6kS_NnHA9OCnOScuCGuBg2", "metadata": ["Title: Hurricane Irma's Cloud Structure as Seen by NASA's AIRS", "Creator: NASA/JPL-Caltech", "Date Created: 2017-09-08", "Rights: JPL", "Album: kboggs"]}, {"id": 50225, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/hurricane-irma-damage-assessment-nasa-bill-white/qgG5FL_oM6m7wg", "description": "The Blue Origin construction site at Exploration Park is seen during an aerial survey of NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on September 12, 2017.

It was the brainchild of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and strongly supported by Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. The airborne operation was undertaken by the First Allied Airborne Army with the land operation by XXX Corps of the British Second Army. The objective was to create a 64 mi salient into German territory with a bridgehead over the River Rhine, creating an Allied invasion route into northern Germany. This was to be achieved by seizing a series of nine bridges with airborne forces, with land forces swiftly following over the bridges. The operation succeeded in liberating the Dutch cities of Eindhoven and Nijmegen along with many towns, creating a 60 mi salient into German-held territory, limiting V-2 rocket launching sites. It failed, however, to secure a bridgehead over the Rhine, with the advance being halted at the river.\nMarket Garden consisted of two sub-operations:\nMarket: an airborne assault to seize key bridges, and;\nGarden: a ground attack moving over the seized bridges creating the salient.", "items": [{"id": 79533, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/trees%E2%80%99-diary-about-%E2%80%98market-garden%E2%80%99/SgEd8VoXcZtqoQ", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/eEgG3vKLASaXbA3tK6IrYXQ8WhvsLUgHOSKhPWMGOmGfet05K4gqFJM7eGE", "metadata": []}, {"id": 49975, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/ZgFW-xKyFEcdYw", "description": "Paratroopers of the British 1st Airborne landing in fields of Arnhem during the opening hours of Operation Market Garden.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/-EBASVCdSMrJYT0ITiCxNMuFn2fKYTEOMZE67gSYHI-grkd75lpmDLEyHzQ", "metadata": ["Date: 1944-09-17", "Location: Holland", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: In Air, Airborne Troops, Wars, Wwii, Netherlands, Arnhem, Great Britain Armed Forces, Action, Airborne Command, Paratroops, 1940s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_1390660", "Credits: LIFE"]}, {"id": 41223, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/radio-free-orange-turntable/LQFtRIId78kd9w", "description": "The 28th of July 1940: \u2018This is\u00a0Radio Oranje, the voice of the Netherlands at war\u2019.Thousands of the Dutch were glued to their radios for the\u00a0initial broadcast of\u00a0Radio Oranje\u00a0(Radio Free Orange).

Such expansion was to be followed, according to Pi\u0142sudski's plans, by the establishment of Intermarium, a Polish-led federation of states in Central and Eastern Europe, meant to function as a bulwark against the re-emergence of German and Russian expansionism.\nOn 13 November 1918, Vladimir Lenin's Russia annulled the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and soon started slowly moving forces in the western direction, to recover and secure the lands, vacated by the German forces, that were lost by the Russian state under the treaty. The first Polish-Soviet skirmishes occurred in mid-February 1919.

It was fought by forces from both the United States and the Philippines against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater. Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle. Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's founding, and Manila became one of the most devastated capital cities during the entire war, alongside Berlin and Warsaw. The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines. The city's capture was marked as General Douglas MacArthur's key to victory in the campaign of reconquest. To date, it is the last of the many battles fought within Manila's history.", "items": [{"id": 14887, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-fight-for-and-the-liberation-of-manila-1945-macarthur/nQH5OKRask-AUw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/ecRGK20Qo1vJoEibmNU306yM3lS_yXPLX2zH_ByXI_IGNQ9yfWjd-NsX", "metadata": ["Title: The Fight For And The Liberation Of Manila -

Wearing armor and carrying a weapon, such as a sword or an ax, they threaten enemies with a fierce look and keep close watch over the surroundings. Each of them has his own symbol (one of the twelve horary signs) on his head. While their dynamic motion is fully captured without exaggeration, their armor and clothes are represented by delicate coloring. The brilliant coloring and use of kirikane (a technique to cut gold leaf into small pieces and paste it on a surface) patterns suggest that the person (or persons) making the votive offering for the creation of these deities had ample means.It is said that these images were originally enshrined at Joruriji Temple in Soraku-gun, Kyoto, which is close to Nara. Considering that Joruriji Temple was established in the late Heian period and has since been passing on the court culture as symbolized by the nine Amitaba Tathagata images and the Pure Land Garden, it seems that the person making the votive offering was a nobleman. The sculptors seem to be members of the Kei school (a group of sculptors of Buddhist images that has produced renowned sculptors such as Unkei and Kaikei), which established a fresh style in the Kamakura period. Their efforts to create 12 unique images can be seen in the varied postures, hairstyles, hand-held symbols and armor shapes. Among the 12 images, these five images are possessed by the Tokyo National Museum and the remaining seven images are owned by the Seikado Bunko Museum (The Tokyo Metropolitan Government ).", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/nfVlHulMpahmbG2k0xjHSpbVbQDTNZafXswM8_41GEL0Yw4ECjKWEHbwrtYt", "metadata": ["Title: Standing Juni Shinsho (Twelve Heavenly Generals): Bishin (Sheep General)", "Date Created: Kamakura period, 13th century", "Provenance(Japanese): \u4f1d\u6d44\u7460\u7483\u5bfa\u4f1d\u6765", "Provenance: Said to have been formerly owned by Joruriji temple, Kyoto", "Physical Dimensions: h713 mm", "Object Title: \u5341\u4e8c\u795e\u5c06\u7acb\u50cf\u3000\u672a\u795e", "Object Notes(Japanese): \u3082\u3068\u4eac\u90fd\u5e9c\u52a0\u8302\u753a\u306e\u6d44\u7460\u7483\u5bfa\u306b\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3068\u4f1d\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b\u5341\u4e8c\u795e\u5c06\u50cf\u3002\u73fe\u5b9f\u611f\u306b\u3068\u3093\u3060\u8868\u60c5\u3084\u8efd\u5feb\u306a\u904b\u52d5\u611f\u306b\u938c\u5009\u6642\u4ee3\u5f6b\u523b\u306e\u7279\u8272\u304c\u9855\u8457\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u540c\u6642\u306b\u6d17\u7df4\u3055\u308c\u305f\u8da3\u3082\u307f\u3048\u308b\u300213\u4e16\u7d00\u521d\u982d\u306b\u3055\u304b\u306e\u307c\u308b\u3001\u904b\u6176\u7cfb\u7d71\u306e\u4ecf\u5e2b\u306e\u4f5c\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002\u3044\u305a\u308c\u3082\u30d2\u30ce\u30ad\u6750\u5bc4\u6728\u9020\u308a\u3002", "Object Date: \u938c\u5009\u6642\u4ee3\u30fb13\u4e16\u7d00", "Medium(Japanese): \u6728\u9020\u3001\u5f69\u8272\u30fb\u622a\u91d1\u3001\u7389\u773c", "Type: Sculpture", "External Link: http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100418/002", "Medium: Wood with polychromy, cut gold leaf and inlaid crystal eyes"]}, {"id": 93443, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/standing-bosatsu-bodhisattva/ywECx0XXw9YOcQ", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/inIeVCjTQndxEYl8gVErqJVFLGi6i0QTPnk7CAIlD1I1f_--o1wEnXD_swYD", "metadata": []}, {"id": 35737, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/a-pair-of-wooden-koma-inu-guardian-dogs-unknown/fgG0Prw82s_AiA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/AGMo9etiAdeb81lkkpAW5EeRqsXoy0d0vGa_TORC68BmJO51RWMCm93lGOA", "metadata": []}, {"id": 31734, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/box-for-noh-mask-with-plovers-design-in-makie-unknouwn/RwGcJyqp3YXj-w", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/wBWvIskj34949r4_ScNH0aSWg3XjqZmUhpOCf-L-_QeaFDFuOGQApRn04UKC", "metadata": []}, {"id": 88172, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/katana-sword-known-as-kikko-sadamune-soshu-sadamune/4QHrx3og9ybV0w", "description": "Sadamune, commonly known as Hikoshir\u00f4, is thought to have been either the real or adopted child of the swordsmith Masamune.

The term contrasts with \"Western Front\", which was being fought in Belgium and France.\nDuring 1910, Russian General Yuri Danilov developed \"Plan 19\" under which four armies would invade East Prussia. This plan was criticised as Austria-Hungary could be a greater threat than the German Empire. So instead of four armies invading East Prussia, the Russians planned to send two armies to East Prussia, and two armies to defend against Austro-Hungarian forces invading from Galicia. In the opening months of the war, the Imperial Russian Army attempted an invasion of eastern Prussia in the northwestern theater, only to be beaten back by the Germans after some initial success.", "items": [{"id": 90453, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/ugGf9pvVlBQObg", "description": "A view showing abandoned Russian trenches in the Augustow Forest, near the Masurian Lakes.", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/ICBRwNz4_RMuW6FJpDj-SsIH5jQZ_b8o1G_eshfylzNTnBenylpw9CuU", "metadata": ["Date: 1914", "Location: Tannenberg, Germany", "Physical Dimensions: B/W PRINT", "Subject Keywords: Tannenberg, Cities, Germany, Wwi, Wars, 1910s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_882819", "Credits: LIFE"]}, {"id": 56734, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/travoys-arriving-with-wounded-at-a-dressing-station-at-smol-macedonia-september-1916-spencer-stanley-sir-ra/TwGkuPtEBb3lgg", "description": "In April 1918, while serving in Macedonia, Spencer was approached by the British War Memorials Committee to complete a commission. This offer was made on the recommendation of fellow artist, Muirhead Bone. Alfred Yockney, Secretary to the Committee, suggested the subject of a religious service at the front but Spencer wanted to show 'God in the bare real things, in a limber wagon, in ravines, in fouling mule lines'. This work is based on his experiences with the 68th Field Ambulance. In August 1919, Spencer included a description of this work in a letter to Alfred Yockney: 'About the middle of September 1916 the 22nd Division made an attack on Machine Gun Hill on the Doiran Vardar Sector and held it for a few nights. During these nights the wounded passed through the dressing stations in a never ending stream. This picture is not in any material or practical sense a truthful representation of the scene it is supposed to depict.' An old Greek church was used as the dressing station and operating theatre. The wounded were brought down by means of the mule-drawn stretchers shown in the painting.In 1923, Spencer wrote to his wife Hilda about the scene for this painting, 'I was standing a little way from the old Greek church and coming there were rows of travoys and limbers crammed full of wounded men. One would have thought that the scene was a sordid one... but I felt there was grandeur... all those wounded men were calm and at peace with everything, so the pain seemed a small thing with them.'Spencer saw the wounded in religious terms: the dead and injured figures on the stretchers like Christs on the Cross and the Resurrection through the lifesaving efforts of the surgeons operating in the makeshift theatre. In 1938, Spencer wrote of the work, 'I meant it not a scene of horror but a scene of redemption'.This is one of a series of paintings commissioned by the by the Ministry of Information early in 1918. The Committee developed a scheme to build a Hall of Remembrance devoted to \u2018fighting subjects, home subjects and the war at sea and in the air\u2019. The centre of the scheme was to be a coherent series of paintings based on the dimensions of Uccello\u2019s \u2018Battle of San Romano\u2019 in the National Gallery (72 x 125 inches), this size being considered suitable for a commemorative battle painting. While the commissions included some of the most avant-garde British artists of the time, the advisors saw the scheme placed within the tradition of artistic patronage, influenced by models from the Renaissance. It was intended that both the art and the setting would celebrate national ideals of heroism and sacrifice. The Hall of Remembrance was never completed and the collection was given to the Imperial War Museum.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/8GsbhTHMvz2RbFl3n2_IF893PHtq4f6dxhhIgKKhugiiIWgdinxpsA9R5t9m", "metadata": ["Title: Travoys Arriving with Wounded at a Dressing-Station at Smol, Macedonia, September 1916", "Creator: Spencer, Stanley (Sir) (RA)", "Date Created: 1919", "Location: Smol, Macedonia", "Physical Dimensions: w2184 x h1828 mm (unframed)", "Provenance: \u00a9 IWM (Art.IWM ART 2268)", "Type: painting", "External Link: Imperial War Museum website", "Medium: oil"]}, {"id": 70182, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/bis-zum-letzten-hauch-die-jahrestage-der-schlacht-bei-tannenberg-der-26-27-und-28-august-seien-darum-opfertage-in-unserer-mark-sie-seien-m%C3%A4rkertage/oQHsIHcrx98W1A", "description": "This poster is part of the political and military collections at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

A dining table with empty plates, a bed, and a house, the comforts of home, flow downstream. A car floats by upside-down, no longer a means of escape. Upstream the bridge has collapsed.

In the nearly four decades since the release of the Magnavox Odyssey, home video game consoles have become a significant part of American culture and the industry has grown into a multi-billion dollar enterprise. The gaming world was once populated primarily by pre-teen and teenage boys, often huddled around televisions in each other's living rooms. Today, players are boys and girls, men and women, both young and old. They still play in their home or dorm room with friends, but increasingly they play online as well. The games they play are a unique combination of technology and graphic art, and game developers have continually pushed the limits of design to create exciting new settings and cutting-edge graphics. The possibilities for the future seem limitless, and \"gamers\" eagerly await the release of advanced consoles and new game titles. Warren Buckleitner, the editor of \"The Children's Technology Review\" and a doctor of educational psychology, has donated a representative sample of educational software games, as well as general PC video games. His extensive collection is an excellent example of the merging of work and play, and will encourage us all to remember that \"Play is our brain's favorite way of learning.\"", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ysj8r_1ce-XuGqz2C5Ua2Fdm86x9vAcrt5JtjrdjIY7NzfAA8LoknWfpcKyIPyQvjw", "metadata": ["Title: Video game:Sydney 2000", "Date Created: 2000", "Location: USA", "Subject Keywords: electronic game, video game, sport, Olympics", "Type: PC Games", "Medium: printed paper, plastic", "Object ID: 109.11106", "Credit Line: Gift of Warren Buckleitner"]}, {"id": 54277, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/sydney-olympics-olympic-torch-arrives-at-bondi-beach/oAFx6MOp0huFVw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/cwV_mvhLHFtSYPGmdcKcY7Xcm5LcvJO00ez8KLUVlmEThgIlprg8j9pBzDGfMzehHw", "metadata": []}, {"id": 31422, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/sydney-olympics-olympic-torch-arrives-at-bondi-beach/RAEtnXhzFQnTZg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/NGVH4KZPGJAI0ST0VNMne4TyDWzQ3ecXf-6eVpoTcV7Lhdc24KKx8ByY1bUYAgI2u1Y", "metadata": []}, {"id": 49939, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/sydney-olympics-torch-arrives-at-bondi-beach/WwFWVGIWbfGOOw", "description": "Sydney 2000 Olympics Torch Arrives at Bondi Beach by North Bondi Surf Boat swept by Paul \"Wingnuts\" Cunningham scored by leisure craft", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wrRmnUr7BPZchmOOws3DPP4ERY_1a2WM0pL4ih6H8A9kqsk6ysf0siM9kVmaCiJGrz8", "metadata": ["Title: Sydney Olympics Torch Arrives at Bondi Beach", "Date Created: 2000", "Inventory: QB_020"]}, {"id": 34759, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/sydney-olympics-olympic-torch-arrives-at-bondi-beach/KQHjBMxf7JYOJg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/9Hiw6szYbrHC8i41bDIAMvO65wpGnTZC1QnDIQ2vnuAkUG9JWJ77VShpZ0HdCq_-", "metadata": []}, {"id": 78467, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/sally-shipard-on-louise-sauvage-s-win-at-the-sydney-2000-olympics/fgFCeT-1RLJvaA", "description": "", "image_url": "//i3.ytimg.com/vi/6yoHm9b2rvo/hqdefault.jpg", "metadata": []}, {"id": 29125, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-27th-olympic-games-held-in-2000-kukkiwon/pgFQHmQcY6KhCg", "description": "Two hundred countries, including East Timor, participated in the 27th Olympic Games.

India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. Hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared through UNSC Resolution 211 following a diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. Much of the war was fought by the countries' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan.

It was one of the first major engagements of the Korean War. An army of 140,000 UN troops, having been pushed to the brink of defeat, were rallied to make a final stand against the invading Korean People's Army, 98,000 men strong.\nUN forces, having been repeatedly defeated by the advancing KPA, were forced back to the \"Pusan Perimeter\", a 140-mile defensive line around an area on the southeastern tip of South Korea that included the port of Busan. The UN troops, consisting mostly of forces from the Republic of Korea Army, United States, and United Kingdom, mounted a last stand around the perimeter, fighting off repeated KPA attacks for six weeks as they were engaged around the cities of Daegu, Masan, and Pohang and the Nakdong River. The massive KPA assaults were unsuccessful in forcing the UN troops back further from the perimeter, despite two major pushes in August and September.", "items": [{"id": 27801, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/29th-regiment-battle-of-taegu/twGo1d_Dw50AKw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/ww2i5pqJwuNB2mrpdIIKCSINODXOA8WDw_P652vzeaXEYEQ-ZoRuvXQK", "metadata": ["Title: 29Th Regiment & Battle Of Taegu", "Date: 1950-08-08", "Location: Korea", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Subject Keywords: Taegu, Regiment, 29th, 1950s, Battle, 1950s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Carl Mydans", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_111516400", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 26889, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/29th-regiment-battle-of-taegu/LAFpVJL3t5A4Wg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/05tFcJzS-ClwfhuccP_VAVGwOxq1slDejlPM7bpSJ4bgYT23b_eZ1czdYg", "metadata": []}, {"id": 77282, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/29th-regiment-battle-of-taegu/kAH1gkHCZjGNPw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/Rt9ozXYHe5Y0HMLX0wcEL81tP76sNv1bps-jwZIzOjyn4dprt1w41ElH", "metadata": []}, {"id": 96917, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/29th-regiment-battle-of-taegu/qAFtvwld-zdE7Q", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/rw1GWvWYM1mj_6BP1juG5BumXUglY0LJi64zf6ejjm-0EGONGAB6lbak", "metadata": []}, {"id": 90329, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/29th-regiment-battle-of-taegu/-QEDtfiyozQP8Q", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/DfTw9N4hip6p0Pps8d1bdwtS7-sGSK2bcwP8aIgnY5-NbeJQGkOcQWHLMNE", "metadata": []}, {"id": 62317, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/29th-regiment-battle-of-taegu/_gGV3U9aAd03jw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/S6yJVUwZsPFvSmV_AzYWbJojCHLKxJmK60VJi5B2Ig00W3NeNWHesAAU", "metadata": ["Title: 29Th Regiment & Battle Of Taegu", "Date: 1950-08-08", "Location: Korea", "Physical Dimensions: B/W NEGATIVE", "Subject Keywords: 1950s", "Publisher: TimeLife", "Usage: For personal non-commercial use only", "Provider: LIFE", "Photographer: Carl Mydans", "Original ID: TimeLife_image_111516371", "Credits: Life Magazine", "Copyright: \u00a9 Time Inc."]}, {"id": 10208, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/29th-regiment-battle-of-taegu/6AFuuVD9SoayvA", "description": "American Col.

Alliance of Argentina, the Empire of Brazil, and Uruguay. It was the deadliest and bloodiest inter-state war in Latin America's history. It particularly devastated Paraguay, which suffered catastrophic losses in population and was forced to cede disputed territory to Argentina and Brazil.\nThe war began in late 1864, as a result of a conflict between Paraguay and Brazil caused by the Uruguayan War. Argentina and Uruguay entered the war against Paraguay in 1865, and it then became known as the \"War of the Triple Alliance\".\nThe war ended with the total defeat of Paraguay. After it was defeated in conventional warfare, Paraguay conducted a drawn-out guerrilla resistance, a disastrous strategy that resulted in the further destruction of the Paraguayan military and much of the civilian population through battle casualties, hunger and disease. The guerrilla war lasted 14 months, until President Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez was killed in action by Brazilian forces in the Battle of Cerro Cor\u00e1 on 1 March 1870.", "items": [{"id": 46580, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/heroi-da-guerra-do-paraguai-adrien-henri-vital-van-emelen/nQEUKgRhZnt0ng", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/XZPXFer_OMTZyudEczyUD9GUiFL2M7DoNxjPiItx1fgePsx0kayF220qVzfP2-ByiEM", "metadata": ["Title: Heroi da Guerra do Paraguai", "Creator: Adrien Henri Vital Van Emelen", "Physical Location: Museu Paulista Da Usp", "Type: Pintura", "External Link: http://acervo.mp.usp.br", "Medium: \u00d3leo Sobre Madeira"]}, {"id": 38431, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/retirada-de-laguna-nair-opromolla-de-ara%C3%BAjo/JwEJG0nFvRaQvw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/MLsi8rIaSXGqTzDpqIfCgbD_wJq4lPoYSmhoCOLvwiuomXxRnwJ6n-EAuUL_xna8", "metadata": ["Title: Retirada de Laguna", "Creator: Nair Opromolla de Ara\u00fajo", "Physical Location: Museu Paulista Da Usp", "Type: Pintura", "External Link: http://acervo.mp.usp.br", "Medium: \u00d3leo Sobre Papel\u00e3o"]}, {"id": 14562, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/soldados-paraguayos-heridos-prisioneros-de-la-batalla-de-yatay/KgHTk58aDRXcww", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/5cQO_Irs1MKze3c_nUsk2LNCJv4UeyhfmDryBoB-z_zUccY7YLNio8CAslA", "metadata": ["Title: Soldados paraguayos heridos prisioneros de la batalla de Yatay", "Date Created: 1892", "t\u00e9cnica: \u00d3leo", "soporte: sobre tela", "Physical Dimensions: w700 x h398 mm", "Painter: C\u00e1ndido LOPEZ", "Collection: Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Argentina", "Type: Painting", "Rights: Public domain"]}]}, {}, {"id": 82610, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/2010-winter-olympics/m018ctl?categoryId=event", "title": "2010 Winter Olympics", "date": "Feb 12, 2010 - Feb 28, 2010", "description": "The 2010 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games and commonly known as Vancouver 2010, was an international winter multi-sport event held from February 12 to 28, 2010 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with some events held in the surrounding suburbs of Richmond, West Vancouver and the University Endowment Lands, and in the nearby resort town of Whistler.\nApproximately 2,600 athletes from 82 nations participated in 86 events in fifteen disciplines.

Thousands of opposition activists were imprisoned without charge, and as many as 91 killed. Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many political prisoners were not released until a general amnesty in 1986.\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep economic recession. The First Secretary Edward Gierek made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Essential goods were being heavily rationed, which acted as a stimulus to establish a first anti-communist trade union in the Eastern Bloc, known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the Gda\u0144sk Agreement, was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to house arrest.", "items": [{"id": 88025, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-demonstration-against-martial-law-on-may-day-1982/9gHds9KvN0ucpQ", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/C8O7edbERZ9rsyvSZJ7-A7oUoCgglZEyhdW74X9PzuSKohcocIjx75T0eF8", "metadata": ["Title: The demonstration against martial law on May Day, 1982", "Location: Zamkowy Square, Warsaw", "Contributor: Polish History Museum | Contributed by East News", "Original Source: Tomasz Wierzejski/FOTONOVA", "Event date: 1982-05-01", "Collection: Polish History Museum"]}, {"id": 95256, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/interned-opposition-activists-during-a-walk-in-the-prison-yard/3gFy6J95gvvn8A", "description": "Interned opposition activists during a walk in the prison yard: Henryk Wujec, Lech Dymarski, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Jacek Kuro\u0144, Jan Rulewski.", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/85mm_0IYwXmymOjKgbQwwQZpmpzQPSXatWBY9PT0V6oPHR0MqA3CwV1wMmU", "metadata": ["Title: Interned opposition activists during a walk in the prison yard", "Date: 1982", "Location: Warsaw, Bialoleka Prison", "Contributor: Polish History Museum | Contributed by East News", "Original Source: \u0141aski Diffiusion/East News", "Collection: Polish History Museum"]}, {"id": 29861, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/general-jaruzelski-announces-martial-law-in-poland/WAE9tVA9WfVfHw", "description": "Martial Law.

King and the SCLC shifted their focus to these issues after observing that gains in civil rights had not improved the material conditions of life for many African Americans.

Patrons of the Stonewall, other Village lesbian and gay bars, and neighborhood street people fought back when the police became violent. The riots are widely considered to constitute one of the most important events leading to the gay liberation movement and the twentieth century fight for LGBT rights in the United States.\nGay Americans in the 1950s and 1960s faced an anti-gay legal system. Early homosexual groups in the U.S. sought to prove that gay people could be assimilated into society, and they favored non-confrontational education for homosexuals and heterosexuals alike. The last years of the 1960s, however, were contentious, as many social/political movements were active, including the civil rights movement, the counterculture of the 1960s and the anti-Vietnam War movement. These influences, along with the progressive environment of Greenwich Village, served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.", "items": [{"id": 50017, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/marsha-p-johnson-at-the-first-christopher-street-liberation-day-march-1970-leonard-fink/BgG3AwUO02rEwQ", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zcRa3P9MOwLtbVKwksYuXA1OdXMxbqEaAtQB56L8lYIwLOgv3BiYCqFbs7WWUEC1", "metadata": []}, {"id": 38373, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/gay-activists-alliance-protest-of-new-york-city-board-of-examiners-1971-richard-c-wandel/qwFQUx05LqoBmQ", "description": "Arthur Evans screams in a man's face at a GAA zap of the NYC Board of Examiners.

In his \"We shall fight on the beaches\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \"miracle of deliverance\".\nAfter Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, France and the British Empire declared war on Germany and imposed an economic blockade.

Following secret promises made by the Allies in the 1915 Treaty of London, Italy entered the war aiming to annex the Austrian Littoral, northern Dalmatia, and the territories of present-day Trentino and South Tyrol. Although Italy had hoped to gain the territories with a surprise offensive, the front soon bogged down into trench warfare, similar to that on the Western Front in France, but at high altitudes and with very cold winters. Fighting along the front displaced much of the local population, and several thousand civilians died from malnutrition and illness in Italian and Austro-Hungarian refugee-camps. The Allied victory at Vittorio Veneto, the disintegration of the Habsburg empire, and the Italian capture of Trento and Trieste ended the military operations in November 1918. The armistice of Villa Giusti entered into force on 4 November 1918, while Austria-Hungary no longer existed as a unified entity.", "items": [{"id": 68051, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/officers-mess-inside-a-quarry-on-the-isonzo-front-unknown/ZQHjAHIimf0Quw", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh6.ggpht.com/R3EhMnjUaabazyBCLfNmEAbLbfSyHXKCB-ZdaWbSKwdEJ3pdnQmCoI2grO4sag", "metadata": []}, {"id": 12028, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/throwing-hand-grenades-on-the-isonzo-front-k-u-k-kriegspressequartier-lichtbildstelle-wien/xgEQtet0kFUFtg", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.ggpht.com/odlAKpIFv-5Z0qUtYNpQB6TUDX6vdzpnO74_By_uzZMfmisHF8Or3OFnM_vwtg", "metadata": []}, {"id": 17007, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/photo-album-of-the-army-years-on-the-italian-front-belonging-to-painter-aurel-popp-bjan-satu-mare-fond-pictorul-popp-s-aurel-dosar-4/DgExeDuMADLcnA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/Z64mhSiMuRP1eaIBUywGysyu16Ky6NmiVkJ1HNg-FUQHz_sPKHNDWRQwWJg", "metadata": []}, {"id": 29819, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/a-bombard-used-on-the-italian-austrian-front-ojetti-ugo/JgE9BXUC42qrYQ", "description": "Picture of a bombard of World War I used on the Italian-Austrian front", "image_url": "//lh5.ggpht.com/t4V1XRmqPlK4cs0LB0I43pYvlDJ1GHkrr0dcVWxaRvRsfV6SiFCggvdEXTUj", "metadata": ["Title: A bombard used on the Italian-Austrian front", "Creator: Ojetti, Ugo", "Date: 1916", "Location: Gorizia", "Provenance: Raccolte Museali Fratelli Alinari (RMFA), Firenze"]}, {"id": 77061, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/soldiers-of-the-italian-army-during-the-water-supply-to-doberd%C3%B2-stabilimento-fotografico-militare/7gHuPZOrnOGdOQ", "description": "Picture of first World War: soldiers of the Italian army during the water supply to Doberd\u00f2", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/5etOunfoTmm2Vy5NQFDhLYbD9WTFnwUnSykA523psRPI4rdCRzSJ94pPz4g", "metadata": ["Title: Soldiers of the Italian army during the water supply to Doberd\u00f2", "Creator: Stabilimento Fotografico Militare", "Date: 1915/1916", "Location: Gorizia", "Provenance: Raccolte Museali Fratelli Alinari (RMFA), Firenze"]}, {"id": 55915, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/rubble-of-a-bombed-railway-bridge-over-the-river-livenza-between-mestre-and-portogruaro-unknown/8AHs14wlDwHrVw", "description": "Picture of \"Italo Austrian War 1915-1918\": rubble of a bombed railway bridge over the river Livenza between Mestre and Portogruaro", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/ByuE4R_SSjQkgmQKRsLMPJ2ERmONMlEKS7m2uuV0kDbgyExyYa2EPdZ_Qrhp", "metadata": ["Title: Rubble of a bombed railway bridge over the river Livenza between Mestre and Portogruaro", "Creator: Unknown", "Date: 1918", "Location: Veneto", "Provenance: Raccolte Museali Fratelli Alinari (RMFA), Firenze"]}, {"id": 64233, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/inspection-of-a-wooden-bridge-for-a-temporary-detour-on-the-piave-impresa-c-m-f-lli-toschi-di-bologna/ngHgCRpbYI_HFg", "description": "Picture of inspection of a wooden bridge for a temporary detour on the Piave, of the Treviso - Motta di Livenza line, work done by the Cleto e Mauro Fratelli Toschi construction firm of Bologna", "image_url": "//lh4.ggpht.com/GECw5lZhD5gbh-fDMI1LeSg_L6AL-ij5AiwBmead84a7UQ5LIBv0ycSsaRI", "metadata": ["Title: Inspection of a wooden bridge for a temporary detour on the Piave", "Creator: Impresa C.

An estimated 2.1\u20133 million, out of a population of 60.3 million, died of starvation, malaria, and other diseases aggravated by malnutrition, population displacement, unsanitary conditions and lack of health care. Millions were impoverished as the crisis overwhelmed large segments of the economy and catastrophically disrupted the social fabric. Eventually, families disintegrated; men sold their small farms and left home to look for work or to join the British Indian Army, and women and children became homeless migrants, often travelling to Calcutta or other large cities in search of organised relief. Historians usually characterise the famine as anthropogenic, asserting that wartime colonial policies created and then exacerbated the crisis. A minority view exists, however, that holds that the famine was the result of natural causes.\nBengal's economy had been predominantly agrarian, with between half and three-quarters of the rural poor subsisting in a \"semi-starved condition\".", "items": [{"id": 40978, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/calcutta-and-bengal-famine/3gHFx9ZgipS0xA", "description": "", "image_url":

Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483, was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Court's unanimous decision stated that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\", and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the decision's 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II only ordered states to desegregate \"with all deliberate speed\".\nThe case originated in 1951 when the public school district in Topeka, Kansas, refused to enroll the daughter of local black resident Oliver Brown at the school closest to their home, instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black elementary school farther away.", "items": [{"id": 82105, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/complaint-in-brown-v-board-of-education-of-topeka-kansas-opinion-page-1/sAEB2GjnUnJyUA", "description": "", "image_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5jYYpwawo_DgL-40F7UPSc5hnA_j1eTKQyLxU3euijPfThk6fNIqx-oTDqGZXnOM", "metadata": ["Title: Complaint in Brown v.

The same year, democrat leaders Eduard Bene\u0161 and Thomas Masaryk were arrested. The dissatisfaction engendered by ideological hypocrisy and economic stagnation increased gradually and erupted three decades later, in 1968, as a result of the experiment of \u201csocialism with a human face\u201d. The liberalisation of the \u201cPrague Spring\u201d resulted in a reform movement throughout Czechoslovak society, articulated in \u201cThe Two-Thousand-Word Manifesto\u201d launched by a group of intellectuals led by Ludvik Vaculik. The emancipation seemed so dangerous to Kremlin \u2013 and its acolytes in Hungary, East Germany, Poland and Bulgaria \u2013 that on the night of 20-21 June 1968 Warsaw Pact troops \u2013 not including troops from Romania, to the country\u2019s credit \u2013 invaded Czechoslovakia, claiming to liberate it. Thus died the hopes of millions of people who believed that communism could be reformed and that communist ideology was compatible with freedom. Later, the Soviets imposed on the leaders of the \u201cPrague Spring\u201d a gradual surrender and the stationing of Soviet troops for an indefinite period. Expulsions from the Party and sackings followed, censorship and terror returned, and the Czechoslovak society sank into deep despair and apathy during the so-called \u201cnormalisation process\u201d. The suicide of student Jan Palach, followed by other suicides in protest, was a symbol of long-term latent resistance. A lot of associations, movements, literary circles, surreptitious universities, jazz clubs were set up, as a means of standing up for human rights and harassing the stagnant communist regime led by Gustav Hus\u00e1k.

They were conducted by Joint Army/Navy Task Force One, headed by Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy rather than by the Manhattan Project, which had developed nuclear weapons during World War II. A fleet of 95 target ships was assembled in Bikini Lagoon and hit with two detonations of Fat Man plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapons of the kind dropped on Nagasaki, each with a yield of 23 kilotons of TNT.\nThe first test was Able.

The twenty four day march lasted from 12 March 1930 to 6 April 1930 as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly. Another reason for this march was that the Civil Disobedience Movement needed a strong inauguration that would inspire more people to follow Gandhi's example. Gandhi started this march with 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march spanned 240 miles, from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, which was called Navsari at that time. Growing numbers of Indians joined them along the way. When Gandhi broke the British Raj salt laws at 6:30 am on 6 April 1930, it sparked large scale acts of civil disobedience against the salt laws by millions of Indians.\nAfter making the salt by evaporation at Dandi, Gandhi continued southward along the coast, making salt and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned to stage a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, 25 mi south of Dandi.", "items": [{"id": 92650, "url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/naidu-and-gandhi-hulton-archive/YgHPdHPkD5VJMA", "description": "1930: Indian poet and politician Sarojini Naidu with Indian nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, 1869 - 1948) during the Salt March protesting against the government monopoly on salt production.
