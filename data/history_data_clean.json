Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but the period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. The term \"cold\" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction discouraged a pre-emptive attack by either side. Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race.", "items": [{"id": 90575, "title": "L'Enrag\u00e9", "description": ""}, {"id": 43272, "title": "Todays Weather", "description": "American president Richard Nixon (1913-1994) points to a map of Southeast Asia during a nationwide broadcast, Viet Nam War.

War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina, just over a month after Lincoln's inauguration. An additional four slave states joined the Confederacy in the following two months.

The revolution erupted in the context of Russia's major military losses during the war, which resulted in much of the Russian Army being ready to mutiny. In the chaos, members of the Duma, Russia's parliament, assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government. This was dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the Russian nobility and aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, and Emperor Nicholas II abdicated his throne.

Following the Race to the Sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France, which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918.\nBetween 1915 and 1917 there were several offensives along this front. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances. Entrenchments, machine gun emplacements, barbed wire and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties during attacks and counter-attacks and no significant advances were made. Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun, in 1916, with a combined 700,000 casualties, the Battle of the Somme, also in 1916, with more than a million casualties, and the Battle of Passchendaele, in 1917, with 487,000 casualties.", "items": [{"id": 45230, "title": "A Battery Shelled", "description": "The First World War, especially the Western Front, was dominated by artillery.

The British responded, recruiting professional miners, and by summer 1916 they had 33 companies of tunnellers at the Western Front.The tunnel at St Eloi was 1,650 feet long and 125 feet deep. It was used to explode the largest mine of the war. This was one of 19 mines exploded at the launch of the Messines offensive in June 1917 and helped the British 41st Division to capture the village.In 1918 David Bomberg, who had served in the Royal Engineers, was commissioned by the Canadian Government to paint the operation. Bomberg was a major figure in the London avant-garde, influenced by Cubism and Futurism. He reduced his subjects to geometric forms, full of tension and kinetic energy. The Canadians, however, asked him to avoid abstraction, and rejected his first painting as too Futurist. This work is a preparatory sketch for a second version, now in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, in which Bomberg compromised and produced a more representational work. The tension and geometry that interested Bomberg are still evident in the complex rhythm of the beams against the curved tunnel walls and in the figures' poses, but the bright colour and bold abstraction of the first work have disappeared.

The painting gives clues about the management of the victims, their relative lack of protective clothing, the impact and extent of the gas attack as well as its routine nature \u2013 the football match goes on regardless.The canvas is lightly painted with great skill. Sargent draws the viewer into the tactile relationships between the blinded men. There is a suggestion of redemption as the men are led off to the medical tents, but the overall impression is of loss and suffering, emphasised by the expressions of the men standing in line. In sharp contrast to the victims, the football players are physically and visually co-ordinated and have full kit.Sargent travelled to France with artist, Henry Tonks in July 1918. Tonks describes the context for this work in a letter to Alfred Yockney on 19 March 1920: 'After tea we heard that on the Doullens Road at the Corps dressing station at le Bac-du-sud there were a good many gassed cases, so we went there. The dressing station was situated on the road and consisted of a number of huts and a few tents. Gassed cases kept coming in, lead along in parties of about six just as Sargent has depicted them, by an orderly. They sat or lay down on the grass, there must have been several hundred, evidently suffering a great deal, chiefly I fancy from their eyes which were covered up by a piece of lint... Sargent was very struck by the scene and immediately made a lot of notes.'Sargent was commissioned by the British Government to contribute the central painting for a Hall of Remembrance for World War One. He was given the theme of 'Anglo-American co-operation' but was unable to find suitable subject matter and chose this scene instead. ' The further forward one goes', he wrote 'the more scattered and meagre everything is. The nearer to danger, the fewer and more hidden the men - the more dramatic the situation the more it becomes and empty landscape.

In July 1940, the air and sea blockade began, with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal-shipping convoys, as well as ports and shipping centres such as Portsmouth.

The scene includes certain elements constant during the Battle of Britain - the river winding from the town and across parched country, down to the sea; beyond, the shores of the Continent, above, the mounting cumulus concentrating at sunset after a hot brilliant day; across the spaces of sky, trails of airplanes, smoke tracks of dead or damaged machines falling, floating clouds, parachutes, balloons. Against the approaching twilight new formations of Luftwaffe, threatening...'The painting majestically reveals the possibilities of art engaged with history. Its ambition and the scale of the setting immediately impress; we look down on a huge swathe of the English Channel and France beyond. Produced at the time of the battle, the painting encapsulates its scale and importance. However, this is not just an image of modern warfare, with its violence and destruction, or even an iconic victory; it is also a restatement of the value of art and the defeat of Nazism. Nash, a fierce critic of the way that fighting on the Western Front of the First World War had been conducted, was immediate and steadfast in his revulsion towards Nazi Germany and its culture. In the painting, defences rise up as if out of the very landscape of England to meet the fascistic machines of war; the regimented patterns of the Luftwaffe are broken and defeated by Allied fighter planes, they form great flower-like shapes in the sky, before plummeting into the very earth that has defeated them.Richard Seddon, pupil of Nash, viewed this work at Nash\u2019s Oxford studio. He advised Nash to include more black smoke trails and painted an example on the canvas. When the painting was exhibited in London, Seddon\u2019s black trail was still visible on the canvas. Margaret Nash presented Seddon with a 19th-century lithograph of a storm in Paris which Nash adapted to form the composition of the Battle of Britain.Nash delivered the work to the Committee in October and it went on display at the National Gallery in January 1942."}, {"id": 71201, "title": "Battle Of Britain Memorial Flight", "description": "Hiding in the rolling landscape of Lincolnshire is the RAF\u2019s high-security Southern Typhoon Main Operating Base (MOB), home to the latest high-tech aircraft including the Eurofighter Typhoon.

Similar bombing raids were mounted in the Visayas. The American air strikes revealed the weakness of Japanese defenses in the Visayas, leading Halsey and MacArthur to conclude that Leyte, and not Mindanao, should be the site of their initial landings.

Widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789, the first since 1614.

This map was revised from a 1607 map by the Dutch chart maker Willem Janszoon Blaeu, and published in 1609 by the Dutch engraver Petrus Kaerius (Pieter van den Keere).\nAccording to the Latin poetry under each figure in Kaerius's map, the monarchs in the screen are identified as the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, the Ottoman Sultan, the Grand Duke of Moscow, and the Great Khan of the Mongolian Tatar. In the analogy with the Dutch map, two couples of monarchs raise their swords and are about to battle against each other.\nThis screen painting is presumed to be painted by Japanese painters in \"Seminario\", schools of the Society of Jesus in Nagasaki in the early 17th century. It might be given by Jesuit leaders to major daimyos including Tokugawa Ieyasu, because it had been inherited in the Matsudaira Clan of the Aizu province (today\u2019s Fukushima pref.) which was established by Hoshina Masayuki (1611-1673), one of the grandsons of Ieyasu. Originally, this screen painting was the one of a pair of eight-panel screens that depicted foreign eight kings on horseback.

Autumn grasses or autumn plains were common subjects for screens but as this pair depicts a new moon on the right-hand screen and Mount Fuji on the left, we know it to be a picture of the Musashino plains. In ancient poems we hear that: \u2018Musashino is a place devoid of peaks behind which the moon may set, just white clouds over the grasses\u2019, or \u2018Musashino is a place with no mountains behind which the moon may set, it rises and sets in the grasses\u2019. This kind of design became popular in the Momoyama period, later becoming standardized during the Edo period. In this work, the grasses are large and depicted with vigor while Mt. Fuji is portrayed in ink with great grandeur, the entire picture overflowing with the richness of nature, making it clear that it was painted in the period before the subject had been reduced to a formalized pattern.\nThere is no signature or seal to identify the artist, but judging from the style, it is thought to be the work of an artist belonging to the Hasegawa school, one theory being that it is by HASEGAWA Togaku (? - 1623), son-in-law of the school\u2019s founder, HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539-1610), another being that it was carried out by Tohaku himself in cooperation with his eldest son, Kyuzo (1568-93). Works in a similar style by the Hasegawa school can be seen in the wall paintings of Chishaku-in Temple, created by Tohaku\u2019s studio, the \u2018Bush Clover and Eulalia Screen\u2019 by Tohaku, or Totaku\u2019s \u2018Autumn Grasses Screen\u2019 (Nanzen-ji Temple). The Hasegawa School was founded by HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539 - 1610), who also referred to himself as the \u2018Fifth Generation Sesshu\u2019 at the same time that UNKOKU Togan was insisting that he was Sesshu\u2019s true successor."}, {"id": 47959, "title": "1.1. scale photo of an Edo period woodblock print marked as a guide for tracing and cutting blocks for a reproduction", "description": ""}, {"id": 21109, "title": "Koto(So)", "description": "This is a So (koto) made by Attribyted Tasuke, who is the famous excellent So maker around Edo period through to Taisho period in Osaka."}, {"id": 18686, "title": "Writing Box with a Man Crossing Ujibashi Bridge from \uff54he Tale of Genji, Lacquer with Maki-e(Sprinkled Gold)", "description": "This inkstone box has an overhanging lid.

After graduating, he began a career in engineering and construction, but at the onset of World War I he was appointed to lead the 4th Infantry Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt. After heading his troops at Gallipoli, in 1916 he moved to the Western Front, where he was to earn his great renown as a tactician, dedicated to minimising casualties through rigorous training, detailed planning and strong technical and mechanical support of his troops. His book on engineering applied to modern warfare, The Australian Victories in France in 1918, was later submitted to the University of Melbourne as a thesis, on the strength of which Monash was awarded the first doctorate in engineering to be conferred by an Australian university. He was promoted to command the Australian Corps in 1918.

For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. The humiliating loss of Korea as a tributary state sparked an unprecedented public outcry. Within China, the defeat was a catalyst for a series of political upheavals led by Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei, culminating in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.\nThe war is commonly known in China as the War of Jiawu, referring to the year as named under the traditional sexagenary system of years.

Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista read the Declaration of Philippine Independence, which he himself had penned. Patterned after the American Declaration, it invoked the protection of God in heaven and \u201cthe Mightly and Humane North American Nation\u201d on earth, dissolved all bonds between Spain and the Philippines, and proclaimed the right of the new republic to exercise all the attributes of a sovereign nation-state.Among the throng that witnessed the independence proclamation was Apolinario Mabini, a paralytic who had to be brought to Cavite in a hammock. He arrived on that very day, 12 June, to become Aguinaldo\u2019s chief adviser on political and constitutional matters. Mabini immediately pointed out the grave implications of the absence of any written pledge of American support for Philippine independence.

While the Tsar managed to keep his rule, the events foreshadowed those of the Russian revolutions in 1917, which resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy, execution of the imperial family, and creation of the Soviet Union by the Bolsheviks.\nSome historians contend that the 1905 revolution set the stage for the 1917 Russian Revolutions, and enabled Bolshevism to emerge as a distinct political movement in Russia, although it was still a minority.", "items": [{"id": 31565, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 53201, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 65172, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 76223, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 31470, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 69345, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution, His Russia 1905", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 20758, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 30524, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 59445, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 37064, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 64088, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 40754, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 29467, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 99566, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 53560, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 95268, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 28452, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 44986, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 52000, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 87013, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 53582, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 92321, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 94285, "title": "His Russia 1905", "description": "His Russia 1905"}, {"id": 74808, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}, {"id": 81466, "title": "His Russia 1905 Revolution", "description": "HIS Russia 1905 Revolution"}], "Coords": {"lat": 59.9310584, "lng": 30.3609096}}, {"id": 35504, "title": "Taish\u014d", "date": 1926, "description": "Taish\u014d is a period in the history of Japan dating from 30 July 1912 to 25 December 1926, coinciding with the reign of the Emperor Taish\u014d.

Rivera executed this metaphorically charged portrait, whose two planes display a strong stylistic contrast with each other, in 1913. The static, elongated, elegantly dressed protagonist stands out in the foreground, standing on a sort of red-railed balcony that distances him from, and raises him above the urban scene in the background i.e. the modern Paris of the time, with a train, factories whose chimneys billow forth clouds of smoke that give an impression of movement, urban buildings depicted in a Cubist style, a futuristically rapid train and, behind everything, a wheel of fortune spinning so dizzily that its spokes are blurred. The aforesaid wheel of fortune, reminiscent of the one built for the 1900 Paris Universal Exhibition, symbolizes technological progress. Rivera succeeded in connecting these two spaces, depicted in different styles, by using perspective to provide a visual link between the protagonist's forefinger and the center of the wheel of fortune, suggesting that man, from a higher plane and acting as a demiurge, directs and promotes progress. Portrait of Adolfo Best Maugard, (a.k.a.

The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably Homer's Iliad. The core of the Iliad describes a period of four days and two nights in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the war's heroes. Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments. Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid.\nThe ancient Greeks believed that Troy was located near the Dardanelles and that the Trojan War was a historical event of the 13th or 12th century BC, but by the mid-19th century AD, both the war and the city were widely seen as non-historical.

This depiction of Ajax and Achilles gaming was especially popular in Athenian art in the late 500s B.C.; over 150 surviving vases show the scene. Why was this image so popular? Some scholars have argued that it was politically motivated. They interpret this scene as a mythical parallel for the tyrant Peisistratos's return from exile, when he was able to regain power because the Athenian army was unprepared for battle. If so, then these vases would be anti-Peisistratid propaganda, alerting Athenians to the importance of vigilance by reminding them of the consequences of their recent failure.

It depicts a scene from the Trojan War, which we know from the inscriptions that identify the two characters: Achilles is tending to his friend Patroclus, whose left arm has been injured by an arrow. He turns his head away with a grimace of pain while his more youthful friend bandages his wound. Achilles is equipped with helmet and armour, which underlines how defenceless Patroclus is. He is only wearing the cap that served as lining under a metal helmet. The shoulder plates of his armour are open and his seated position on his shield, his genitals in full view, epitomises his vulnerability by revealing his weakest point where he later receives the fatal blow from Hector. The scene of this apparently harmless injury actually predicts the death of Patroclus and points to the end of Achilles who, despite a warning prophecy, enters battle to avenge the death of his friend where he too meets his tragic fate, dying at a young age. A recent interpretation suggests that the scene also invokes the homoerotic relationship between the two heroes, a further aspect that the user of the cup could identify with: in the late Archaic period \u2013 that is in the era of the symposium \u2013 the relationship between an older lover (erastes) and a younger beloved (eromenos) was a widespread phenomenon in Athenian society. The world of the Olympian gods is depicted on the outside of the bowl. They are gathered around the ruling couple Zeus and Hera and are pouring wine on the ground from ornate offering bowls as a sign of their divinity. Within this closed circle \u2013 those sitting down take no notice of new arrivals \u2013 Herakles is being introduced by his half-brothers and sister Hermes, Apollo and Athena. In recognition of his difficult life and painful death, he is being admitted into the world of the gods as the son of Zeus. Both scenes would have been considered appropriate for grave goods so it is no surprise that the bowl was found in a tomb in Etruscan Vulci. However, it was made in Athens and signed with pride by the potter Sosias on the base. The original name of the talented painter who worked with the potter in Antiquity is unfortunately not known.

This scene was very popular in Athenian vase-painting of the late 500s B.C. and was a favorite of the painters in the Leagros Group. Some scholars believe that this mythological scene also served as a contemporary political parable on the value of staying alert, since the tyrant Peisistratos had been able to take control of the city of Athens while the army was distracted. The back of the vase depicts three hoplites, or warriors, in a line. Such files of hoplites are rather unusual in vase-painting, and this depiction may have been meant to relate to the scene on the front of the vase. These hoplites may be Greeks on the march to counter a Trojan attack, while Ajax and Achilles are notified by Athena.

He was given the vase out of the estate of Frederic count De Thoms, an 18th-century romantic adventurer. In 1844 the vase came into the possession of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden. This red-figure amphora features a refined painting. The red-figure technique was developed around 530 B.C. Before that time vases were black-figured, the painting being done in black-colouring clay on a red background.\nWith this new technique it was the opposite: the space outside the outlined decoration was done in black, leaving the figures red. Thus it became possible to add certain refinements with a brush. The figures become more flexible and their clothes are rendered inmore detail. Black-figure pottery usually features stiff figures in silhouette. In red-figure pottery they are turned towards the beholder and sometimes done in three quarters, possessing more depth.\nOn the front of the vase we see a picture of the combat between Achilles (left) and Memnon (right) during the Trojan war. The scene is described in Homer\u2019s Iliad. Above the scene, the heroes\u2019mothers are watching the combat, while the god Hermes is weighing the souls on a pair of scales, which tip the wrong way for Memnon.

Zeus, the king of the gods, commanded that the dispute must be settled by Paris, the handsome young son of King Priam of Troy. Each of the goddesses offered the young man a bribe for his vote. Aphrodite, whom Paris picked, promised him Helen, the most beautiful mortal woman. Paris's running off with Helen, who was already married to the Greek king of Sparta, sparked the Trojan War. His choice of Aphrodite also earned the hatred of Athena and Hera and sealed the fate of the Trojans. On this vase, the three goddesses trail along behind Hermes, who is identified by his kerykeion. Paris steps forward and shakes hands with Hermes, accepting his fate. The other side of the vase depicts a scene of two men between sphinxes.\n\nScholars have had difficulty determining the origin of this amphora.

Thus armed, the Greek hero returns to the battlefield to take revenge on Hector for killing his friend Patroclus. An anvil beside the goddess reflects the role of the god as divine craftsman. Whilst the image on the inside is set in the world of the gods which, regardless of the scene itself, is nothing unusual, the outside of the bowl offers us a glimpse into a workshop in which bronze statues are being made. On one side, the larger-than-life statue of a warrior in fighting pose is supported within a high wooden scaffold. He protects his body with a round shield and his elevated right hand is poised to throw the lance it holds. The cheek guards of the helmet are turned up which was not customary at the time, no doubt artistic licence taken by the sculptor to show off the face more clearly. The statue is not fully finished. Two workers, one with the characteristic leather cap of the smith, smooth the surface with scrapers. A second statue of an athlete with raised arms is lying down on a bed of sand or clay. An assistant is holding onto one of the arms and is aiming carefully towards the right hand with his hammer. A line on the wrist shows that the different parts were cast separately and have not yet been properly joined. The head of the statue still has to be mounted and lies on the floor between the legs of the artisan. A third group of artisans are busy with the kiln, which has a very tall chimney. A young man behind the kiln stokes the fire with a bellows. No doubt, they are heating the solder in the fire to join the parts of the reclining statue. Workshops of this kind were found all over the potters\u2019 quarter or Kerameikos in Athens. The vase painters would have been familiar with the work that went on there from their own observations. Nevertheless, there are some things, for instance the kiln, which have been altered to suit artistic conventions. Social views are also reflected in the details. For instance, the fact that the worker sitting at the kiln is posed in such a way that his genitals can be seen would not have been socially acceptable \u2013 such a pose was only used to portray slaves or satyrs. Two men leaning on a staff and observing the goings on stand out from the workers. They are probably not the owners of the workshop but simply citizens of Athens who have stopped by the workshop on their way to the palaestra \u2013 or wrestling school.

The obverse of the Cincinnati krater depicts one such episode, taken from the Homeric cycle on the Trojan War. Here a goddess with a diadem, holding a spear, intervenes in a combat between two warriors. One advances with lance poised, while the other falls backward with sword drawn in self-defense. The most likely contestants in this battle are the Greek hero Achilles and his Trojan adversary Hector. Their duel, described in Book 22 of the \"Iliad,\" was a popular subject among Athenian vase painters. Alternatively the scene may depict Aphrodite protecting her Trojan son Aeneas from the onslaught of the Greek Diomedes.

The painter of the Leagros group who decorated this vase labeled Aphrodite, Aeneas, and Anchises, adding a popular formulaic comment on their beauty, but he also added a variety of nonsense inscriptions--just meaningless combinations of letters--to the vase. The back of the vase depicts Dionysos, the god of wine, frolicking with satyrs, his partially human companions.

More than three million men fought in the battle and one million men were wounded or killed, making it one of the deadliest battles in human history.\nThe French and British had committed themselves to an offensive on the Somme during the Chantilly Conference in December 1915. The Allies agreed upon a strategy of combined offensives against the Central Powers in 1916 by the French, Russian, British and Italian armies, with the Somme offensive as the Franco-British contribution.

The clouds are typical of tropical areas both nearby and away from tropical cyclones. Observations were taken at 1 p.m. EDT (5 p.m. UTC) on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2017, as Irma approached the Caribbean islands and was just becoming a powerful Category 5 storm. Each cylinder represents a volume of cloud detected by AIRS. The oval cylinder ends represent a region viewed by AIRS, with the oval sizes adjusted to reflect the proportion of clouds filling the area viewed. The largest ovals are about 30 miles (45 kilometers) across. The height of the cylinders indicates the cloud thickness, with thickest clouds reaching down to the surface. The vertical scale is exaggerated 15 times. Colors represent temperatures at the tops of the clouds. The perspective views the storm diagonally from above with an initial view toward the north-northwest, with the perspective rotating clockwise for a full circle. The area depicted is about 1,000 miles by 800 miles across (1,600 by 1,300 kilometers). At the start of the loop, North America is seen at the top of the image, and coastal Venezuela at the lower right. In the initial perspective, cirrus clouds (thin and blue), associated with flow outward from the top of the hurricane, overlie warmer (pink and red) shallow clouds. About five seconds into the loop, the deep clouds in the middle of Irma are easily seen. The most dangerous parts of Irma are within the region of high and cold (blue), thick clouds surrounding the central eye. The clouds are cold because they are carried to high, cold altitudes by vigorous thunderstorms within the hurricane. The eye itself is nearly cloud free, but the few clouds within it are low and warm. As the perspective shift toward the south-southeast around seven seconds into the loop, another storm system well north of Irma can be seen. It contains high, thick clouds, with more cirrus carried outward over shallow clouds. At about nine seconds, more outflow from Irma is seen, with high, thin clouds over shallow clouds once again apparent. Shortly afterward when the view is toward the southwest, yet more deep clouds and their outflowing cirrus clouds are apparent. This image depicts many of the clouds typical of the tropics even when cyclones are not present: high, cold thunderstorms pushing cirrus clouds over nearby regions containing many warm, shallow clouds. The animation also shows the structure typical of tropical cyclones around the world: very strong thunderstorms lifting clouds into cold parts of the atmosphere, with strong outflow at upper levels carrying cirrus clouds away from the storm center, and the storm organized symmetrically around a central eye."}, {"id": 50225, "title": "Hurricane Irma Damage Assessment", "description": "The Blue Origin construction site at Exploration Park is seen during an aerial survey of NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on September 12, 2017.

He was a salaried war artist with an honorary commission of Captain in the Royal Marines and would have been able to paint from his own observations. His wartime style has been compared to the sixteenth century Flemish painter Pieter Breughel whose work shows a similar attention to distant detail and purposeful activities.

The UN troops, consisting mostly of forces from the Republic of Korea Army, United States, and United Kingdom, mounted a last stand around the perimeter, fighting off repeated KPA attacks for six weeks as they were engaged around the cities of Daegu, Masan, and Pohang and the Nakdong River. The massive KPA assaults were unsuccessful in forcing the UN troops back further from the perimeter, despite two major pushes in August and September.", "items": [{"id": 27801, "title": "29Th Regiment & Battle Of Taegu", "description": ""}, {"id": 62317, "title": "29Th Regiment & Battle Of Taegu", "description": ""}, {"id": 10208, "title": "29Th Regiment & Battle Of Taegu", "description": "American Col.

In his \"We shall fight on the beaches\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \"miracle of deliverance\".\nAfter Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, France and the British Empire declared war on Germany and imposed an economic blockade.

Fighting along the front displaced much of the local population, and several thousand civilians died from malnutrition and illness in Italian and Austro-Hungarian refugee-camps.

Millions were impoverished as the crisis overwhelmed large segments of the economy and catastrophically disrupted the social fabric. Eventually, families disintegrated; men sold their small farms and left home to look for work or to join the British Indian Army, and women and children became homeless migrants, often travelling to Calcutta or other large cities in search of organised relief. Historians usually characterise the famine as anthropogenic, asserting that wartime colonial policies created and then exacerbated the crisis. A minority view exists, however, that holds that the famine was the result of natural causes.\nBengal's economy had been predominantly agrarian, with between half and three-quarters of the rural poor
